Reviewers particularly liked the systematic approach, the interactive features, and the potential for longer-term impact. At the same time, reviewers raised concerns and made suggestions about these and other issues. \n\nOverall, the paper seems well-positioned for minor revisions, though there are several points which may require additional review (e.g. clarifying issues about the taxonomy).\n\nThe authors should review individual reviews #11, #12, #17 for specific items to address. These can even be referenced using GitHub features as changes are made. Here also is a summary of concerns that came up across several reviews, with some additional thoughts and suggestions:\n\n- Justifying or re-framing the taxonomy (relevant reviews: #17, #11). In particular, #17 raises several critical points on the framing and definitions surrounding the taxonomy. One option may be to reframe-- i.e. taxonomy has a specific meaning in certain research communities-- is this paper trying to propose one? Might a different term be used? Or is the goal to develop a useful set of terminologies and categorizations to support the dataset project at this early stage? Another option might be to lean into the taxonomy term and more rigorously develop and define the proposed taxonomy.\n- Long term maintenance of GLaDOS (relevant reviews: #11, #12, #17). All reviews raise this issue in some form. There appears to be tangible value and potential in the proposed GLaDOS approach. For example, OSF was seen as a positive for its commitment to longevity. However, reviews surfaced multiple specific concerns, such as how to update, how to broaden (e.g. other communities). The authors might consider updating with some additional discussion on possible maintenance models. (One potential suggestion here: there may be a useful community-driven model to be developed, i.e. using the issues and pull-requests features of GitHub and similar platforms for the community GLaDOS supports. The IEEE VIS website model comes to mind.)\n- Features of the GLaDOS interface (relevant reviews: #11, #12, #17). Reviews raised specific requests for additional filtering criteria or features for the website interface. I would suggest the authors either: 1) consider these and implement them where possible or 2) or document them and provide explanation for why they may be technically out of scope or otherwise not in line with how GLaDOS proposes to support navigation of datasets. (Again, Issues for features might be a nice way to open up dialogue about these. Certainly not required, but potentially useful for more focused discussion if helpful.)\n\nAuthors and reviewers are invited to discuss changes and seek clarifications as supported by the platform and reviewing process.\n\n### Decision\n\nMinor revisions: this paper requires some smaller changes, after which I am confident I would be able to endorse it.\n",

			"body": "Thank you, reviewers, for the very detailed reviews! \nI did my best to address all of the comments. I hope I managed to satisfy the requests. \n\n**Accessibility:**\nI removed the citation tooltips as requested in Issue #15. \nI tested the website with macOS voiceover, as it has been done in Issue #15, and the navigation does not get stuck in the bars of the barcharts for me (using control+option and directional keys to navigate the page). Perhaps I am missing how to replicate the problem?\n\nOh, we also started using uv for simplifying the setup as mentioned in #13.\n\n**Changes to the website:**\nThe website is now a little faster when loading - before, users needed to wait some time for the contents to be loaded. I achieved this by removing a dependency, which wasn’t really used much and was somehow slowing down everything. I also added an additional page - accessible from the top of the main index page, called about.html, which contains additional explanations, information on how to contribute, citation info... \n\n**Search function:** \nIssue #11 mentions, as a feature to be added, a search function. I added a search bar both in the website and on the paper, where datasets can be searched by title and feature.\n\n**“Taxonomy” wording:**\n> (Issue #17) \"This work proposes an overarching taxonomy of datasets\", but I feel it is a stretch to call it this. There are a number of inconsistencies and questions about the categorisation, as described below. The classification should be made more thorough and precise, or this claim reduced.\n\nI agree: There really was no reason to call this a taxonomy, and it is present in only one sentence in the whole paper. I changed the wording to “working classification”.\n\n**Maintenance (Issue #12, Issue #17):**\nI created an issue template on github to submit requests.\nFor maintenance, we use Notion to keep track of the datasets and to collaboratively edit the CSV files. While Notion is a proprietary platform, all the data remains in plain CSV format, which means we can easily migrate to other tools if needed. The use of Notion is just a convenience, nothing is locked into it.\n\nI expanded a section in the body of the paper to include this:\n“Maintenance plans and contribution to the repository:\nContributions to the dataset collection (corrections, integrations, replacement) are most welcome — and strongly encouraged. However, to ensure data quality and avoid accidental overwriting or inconsistency, we don’t allow direct edits to the files by everyone. Instead, there are two main ways to contribute:\nPull requests: If you prefer to fill in all the information yourself, you can submit a pull request directly to the repository. The data for both the papers and the datasets is stored in CSV format, [available here](https://github.com/VisDunneRight/gd_benchmark_sets/tree/master/notion_data).\nGitHub issues: If you’d rather just point us to a new dataset or share some additional info (e.g., missing metadata, clarifications, or links), we’ve created an[ issue template](https://github.com/VisDunneRight/gd_benchmark_sets/issues/new?template=dataset-inclusion.md) to make that easier. We’ll then take care of adding the dataset and filling in whatever information we can find or infer.\nEven without external contributions, we actively monitor the space and try to keep the repository up to date as new datasets emerge. And if none of the options above work for you, feel free to just[ reach out to us](http://localhost:6939/#nte-post-abstract) — we’re happy to handle things more informally as well.\nThat said, it’s worth noting a clear limitation: this collection does not aim to be exhaustive. The starting point for the dataset list was a literature review covering a few hundred papers, which means it’s entirely possible that some benchmarks were missed — especially if they weren’t cited often or were introduced in more obscure venues. For this reason, contributions from the community are especially valuable to help fill in the gaps and keep the resource as useful and complete as possible.”\n\nSome related comments in the reviews are addressed here:\n\n> (Issue #17) The future maintainability of the work is unclear. That is, there is no commitment or plan in the article of the future maintainability of the archive as new graph data sets are published. It would be good to see a plan for this, whether it is the authors or as an open project. If the later there might be a need to document the processes for maintenance to allow others to update the GLaDOS website.\n\nand\n\n> (Issue #17) The article makes it clear that all datasets are sourced from the review of literatures, but the GLaDOS website doesn't give any details of where they were sourced, other than the \"Benchmark datasets\" category saying \"These are collections of graphs that have been frequently used in graph drawing papers\" which is then not listed under the other categories. There should be a sentence or two on the website that explains all datasets came from graph drawing literature.\n\nI added a section in the “about.html” part of the website, and expanded the invitation to contributing in the paper, as well as pointing to the right resources containing the data and creating a github template for contributing.\n\n**Discrepancies between the website and the paper:**\n\n> (Issue #17) The descriptions on the website are clearly hand-authored and are inconsistent in the presented information. \n\nThe hand-authored descriptions in the paper were intentionally written in a more colloquial and narrative tone, to make the content feel like a cohesive text rather than a series of catalog entries. This choice was made to support readability and discussion, especially for a publication format where we wanted to highlight patterns, nuances, and commentary rather than simply list dataset fields.\n\nThat said, all the factual information present in these descriptions — such as number of graphs, structural properties, and other metadata — is systematically reflected in the underlying data and is accessible through the structured CSV files and website. We understand the importance of consistency, and while the prose may vary to suit narrative flow, the core dataset information remains complete and aligned across both formats.\n\n**Clarification on the classification of the datasets:**\n> (Issue #17) Some of the Datasets are classes of graph rather than a single data set. For example \"Social Networks\" is from 4 data sources. Does this mean all the papers that use this use all 4 or just 1. If the later, this makes the presentation of the most-used data sets questionable with Social Networks being number 4.\n\nMost papers only use one of them, not all four. We grouped them to reflect how often “social networks” as a class of graphs are used in layout evaluations, but we see how this may inflate the appearance of that group in the ranking.\n\nTo address this, we’ve now added a note in the ranking section to explain how grouped categories were handled. We also revised the language to make it clear that the ranking reflects grouped usage, not necessarily a single, unified dataset.\n\n> (Issue #17) The difference between \"Uniform Benchmark\" and \"Established Network Repository\" is not clear, especially as it related to subset collections.\n\nand \n\n> (Issue #17) The article says \"Uniform Benchmark datasets\" \"aims to provide a general overview of the performance of a graph layout algorithm by testing on a large amount of graphs varying in size and density, rather than focusing on a specific type of graph\". It is not clear what \"specific type of graph\" means. For instance, it could be argued that all graphs in the Storylines dataset are a specific type of graph.\n\nBy **Uniform Benchmark** we mean datasets that were explicitly curated and released together for the purpose of evaluating layout algorithms (e.g., with common format, goals, or metrics in mind). In contrast, an **Established Network Repository** refers to larger, more general-purpose archives like SNAP or KONECT, which collect a wide variety of networks, often across domains, and not specifically for layout evaluation.\nSubset collections taken from these repositories fall into the second category unless they were later re-released in a more curated form for layout evaluation — in which case we list both (and cross-reference them in the dataset notes). We’ve clarified this in the text.\n\n> (Issue #17) Why categorise the North DAGs and AT&T graphs separately, and then in the North NAGs description, just have See AT&T\". Given the focus on reproducibility, It would make more sense to have this as an alias for the AT&T dataset and combine them in the listing.\n\nI think it would be relevant to keep this information explicit (which paper calls a certain dataset with which name) - also, if any author is looking specifically for “North DAGs” (because it was perhaps mentioned on a paper that called it with this name), it is a good way to redirect them to the other version of the dataset.\n\n> (Issue #17) For the \"Established Network Repositories\" the article says \"we do not include here any storage of the data (which would be redundant) or report statistics on them\" but provided information (size information, min/max nodes, node distribution and summary charts) would be useful since that allows people to select the appropriate data set. If the issue with generating stats is that they could becoe outdated if the collection is added to, you could say the information was based on a date and then potentially update these as part of the maintenance of GLaDOS.\n\nSo this is a choice we had to make. Arguably, these other network repositories are doing a job that is similar to GLaDOS, only not very focused on benchmarking layout algorithms. It is not really my intention to re-do their work, and neither it is to re-upload their data, as clearly there are active groups of maintainers working on them. They do report their own statistics, they did their own work, and it’s not my intention to step on their toes by replicating their work. We only cared about storing datasets that are clearly not currently cared for.\n\n> (Issue #17) The KnownCR set lists the \"Known Crossing Number\" tag, but is this value included in the data (graph downloads) for each graph in the dataset?\n\nNo, for the same reason as above. \n\n> (Issue #17) The article says \"One more of such collections is Konect. At the time of writing, though, the website for Konect has been down for a while. Both the data and the website are still accessible through web archive—thus we do not consider this a lost collection.\" Why is the Konect dataset not included in the collection then?\n\nLuckily we found that Konect is back online! I added it back to the list of datasets. I did not include in the original list because we have no papers actually referencing Konect as a source for their dataset. It is a bit of a choice I had to make: do I include a dataset even if it is not used in any of the papers I include in the ones I collected? I am aware of it, but it did not come up using the same methods we used for the rest of the collections. Anyways, it’s really valuable as a collection, so I added it back. However, I do not have any examples of how it was used in papers.\n\n> (Issue #17) For a dataset like \"Car Features\" where the features are not known, the dataset is unavailable and the author won't disclose the origin of the data, is there value including it at all, except maybe in a list of papers that fit this category (I imagine there might be many).\n\nWe still think it’s important to document the existence of this, not as usable benchmark, but as part of the landscape of datasets that have been referenced in layout evaluation work, especially when they appear in published papers.\n\n**Clarification on “custom-made” datasets, reconstructed datasets (Issue #11):**\n\nIt is important to make it clear that we did not attempt reconstructing any dataset - we only collected them as-is, when we could. I clarified this in the paper.\n\n> (Issue #11) Discuss Potential Bias in Dataset Selection – Since some datasets were reconstructed, it would help to include a short note on how the selection process might introduce bias and what was done to minimize this.\nWe did not reconstruct any datasets — all of them were taken as-is from existing sources. We only worked towards finding datasets, never reconstructing them.\n\nThe one thing that might introduce some bias is how the datasets were collected in the first place. We mostly relied on literature search and snowballing, so of course we can’t claim to have found everything that exists. Some datasets may have been missed simply because they weren’t cited often or were harder to find. We now mention this in the paper to make it clearer, and we added a note that the repository is open to community contributions to help fill in any gaps.\n\n> (Issue #11) Clarify Data Consistency Checks – There is no clear mention of how the authors ensured data accuracy and consistency across different sources. A brief explanation would strengthen transparency.\n\nWe don’t do aggregation between different sources — we mostly report the data as it appears in the original sources, all of what we could find. That’s also why we include descriptions from the literature directly: if two papers describe the same dataset differently, we don’t try to resolve the contradiction, we just show both. This way, we avoid introducing our own interpretation and let readers see how the dataset has been presented in different contexts. We’ve now clarified this point in the paper as well.\n\n> (Issue #17) It also talks about sub-categories of Replicable vs. Reproducible vs non-replicable. Where does this information appear in the GLaDOS website? This is not clear.\n\nThe GLaDOS website only hosts datasets that we found in their entirety. We never attempted reproducing a dataset — especially not the ones that didn’t give enough details to be perfectly replicable, because this could introduce biases, issues, imprecisions. Because of this, we do not deem really relevant to have this information on the website, as there is no mention of datasets that are not perfectly replicable. The GLaDOS website does not host anything that we classified as “custom-made”.\n\n**Highlighting the limitations of the collection (Issue #12)**\n\nWe do recognize that some papers might have been overlooked. However, as per every survey, we need limits. Anyways, we streamlined a bit the way in which people can contribute, by having a github issue template and better explaining how maintenance will be handled (see previous section, “Maintenance”). \n\n**Clarifying differences with W. Hu et al. (Issue #17)**\n\n> (Issue #17) When mentioning the work of W. Hu et al. having a different focus, the article should explain why it is not relevant.\n\nExpanded explanation: “The [Open Graph Benchmark](https://ogb.stanford.edu/) collection from W. Hu et al. ([2020](http://localhost:7063/#ref-hu2020)) is also worth mentioning. It provides an important infrastructure for evaluating machine learning methods on graph-structured data, including datasets, tasks, and evaluation metrics, but it is not focused on layout quality or human-perceived readability of graph visualizations. Our work complements such efforts by specifically targeting datasets designed to evaluate the perceptual and aesthetic dimensions of layout algorithms, which are not addressed in W. Hu et al. ([2020](http://localhost:7063/#ref-hu2020)).”\n\n**Clarifying how we found some unavailable datasets**\n> (Issue #17) The article says they looked \"into internal storages of research groups\". Please clarify what this means. Does it mean the authors contacted someone else from their previous group, if the author was no longer there and didn't have the data themselves, and they looked in the internal storage?\n\nYes, that’s more or less what we meant. We’ve now clarified the sentence in the paper. In a few cases, when datasets were not publicly available, we reached out to the authors directly, and if we had access (for example, by being part of the same institution or having contacts in the group), we checked whether the data was still stored somewhere internally — like in shared drives, old project folders, or archived backups. This sometimes helped retrieve datasets that were not accessible online anymore. We’ve reworded the sentence in the paper to make this clearer.\n“We also reached out to colleagues in other universities who we knew had worked with certain datasets in the past, and asked if they could check their internal storage — for example, shared drives or old project folders — to see if the data was still available.”\n\n**File formats:**\n> (Issue #17) The section on file formats (3.1) is unclear. It says \"We chose to convert and store several of the datasets in a uniform JSON representation\". Why only \"some\"? It says \"we have also converted and made available all graphs in three additional commonly-used formats: GraphML, GEXF, and GML\". Why have \"multiple accessible formats\"? Do these all have exactly the same information, or do some lack the extra information (\"timestamps, labels, or belonging to a clusters, and edges having weights\"). The article and website should make clear if there is a master format for everything and then convenience formats and what information they each contain. Otherwise people could end up comparing graphs that are actually different (for info like clusters) when thinking they are the same.\n\nIt was specified on the paper that we chose JSON as the “main” format. All of the other formats are provided as a courtesy and contain the same information (metadata, additional attributes). I updated the description to be explicit about the fact that all of them are equivalent.\n\n**Other minor comments:**\n\n> (Issue #17) \"the graph structure is very difficult to piece together\" This could be explained. Is it because it is in an uncommon format, or that the source data is something like Twitter posts.\n\nThis was about uncommon formats. I specified it in the paper.\n\n> (Issue #17) The figure (data collection process) at the beginning of Section 3 should be labelled and have a caption.\n\nDone. It actually had a caption, but was missing the “Figure” label.\n\n> (Issue #17) \"the original data we downloaded when the files were small enough to be uploaded to GitHub\". What does this mean? Why does it matter?\n\nIt did indeed not matter. I removed it.\n\n> (Issue #17) In Section 4.2 \"Random Generation\"The article says \"The list of features to take into account to claim that a synthetic graph is comparable to another one would be long, and perhaps out of the scope of this publication. These are just a few examples of what could be relevant:\" What follows looks like a list produced by GenAI with no explanation of where this came from (at least I got similar result crafting a quick prompt from the text above). I question what this list contributes to the paper. If it is to be included, it should be shortened and properly justified.\n\nSo sorry, that list was actually the result of a brainstorming session and not made with AI. As you can see from the amount of typos you spotted, AI was used very little for this paper (: \nI have replaced the list with this statement:\n\n“Comparing two synthetic graph collections meaningfully is not straightforward. Without shared generation procedures or metadata, it’s difficult to claim that they represent comparable input conditions for layout evaluation. A number of structural and contextual features may affect comparability, including, for example, graph size (nodes and edges), density, and distribution of components or motifs. Even small changes in these properties can have a significant impact on layout results.\nWhile a full discussion of all relevant factors is beyond the scope of this paper, we highlight this issue to caution against assuming that two synthetic datasets are interchangeable just because they were randomly generated. A more careful analysis of their structural characteristics is often necessary.”\n\n> (Issue #17) References should be given for \"Erdős-Rényi\", \"Barabási-Albert\" and also the sentence beginning \"Conversely, the BA model produces scale-free networks with... \"\n\nReferences added!\n\n> (Issue #17) In Section 5, the difference between gray and blue dots in Figure 8 is almost impossible to distinguish. Please use more visually distinct colours or a different mark.\n\nColor was changed to red.\n\nIn addition to these items, I fixed all the typos mentioned in the reviews.

I can skip over the group by using control+opti0on+shift and then left and right. Those skip over the groups. But the content of the groups is still mostly noise and should ideally be hidden from the screen reader. Please try to impove the screen reader experience but I think this may also be because of the library you use. Maybe file an issue with them.\n\nThanks for making the other fixes! \n\nEither way, because the groups can be skipped, I consider this not blocking for acceptance. So I approve the paper. ",

			"body": "### Conflicts of interest\n\n- [x] I declare that I have no known conflicts of interest with the authors.\n\n### Reviewed version\n\nf41e831\n\n### Review\n\nThe article describes GlaDOS, a website providing a collection of benchmark graph datasets. GLaDOS provides the graphs in several common formats or links to their source (where this is actively curated elsewhere).  Additionally, the site contains various tags and statistics, a summary of each data set and a description of its origin and uses of those datasets within the literature.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- The presented collection of datasets were collected through a clearly time-consuming process that even involved recreating graphs through author instructions or contacting lab members to secure missing data.\n\n- The presented collection also includes lots of valuable information on the origin and uses of each dataset.\n\n- It makes a valuable contribution in making these available in perpetuity both through the GLaDOS website and providing the underlying code and instructions behind the site.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- The entries for datasets within the article and on the GLaDOS website are hand-authored and inconsistent in terms of the information provided and the formatting. This brings into question the reliability and accuracy of this data.\n\n- The high-level classification of datasets is also unclear and some surprising choices, raising questions about the value of the \"taxonomy\" contribution.\n\n- Ongoing plans for upkeep and maintenance of the GLaDOS are not described.\n\n- The included datasets are based on papers mostly from the Graph Drawing conference during a set period and with several citations (plus associated papers).  While this is reasonable selection criteria it means the collection is not exhaustive.\n\n- The article has a number of minor issues, described below, that require more explanation or clarification.\n\n### Review content\n\n- Article says \"Our organization by features and statistics supports rapid identification of\nrelevant graphs\".  While the article itself lets people filter by feature, the website (the actual collection) doesn't provide any filtering or search, just a long table-style list with a \"Features\" column. To satisfy its intended purpose, the website needs some search/filtering capability.\n\n- When mentioning the work of W. Hu et al. having a different focus, the article should explain why it is not relevant.\n\n- The article says they looked \"into internal storages of research groups\".  Please clarify what this means.  Does it mean the authors contacted someone else from their previous group, if the author was no longer there and didn't have the data themselves, and they looked in the internal storage?\n\n\n- The figure (data collection process) at the beginning of Section 3 should be labelled and have a caption.\n\n- \"the graph structure is very difficult to piece together\" This could be explained.  Is it because it is in an uncommon format, or that the source data is something like Twitter posts.\n\n- The section on file formats (3.1) is unclear.  It says \"We chose to convert and store several of the datasets in a uniform JSON representation\". Why only \"some\"?  It says \"we have also converted and made available all graphs in three additional commonly-used formats: GraphML, GEXF, and GML\". Why have \"multiple accessible formats\"?  Do these all have exactly the same information, or do some lack the extra information (\"timestamps, labels, or belonging to a clusters, and edges having weights\").  The article and website should make clear if there is a master format for everything and then convenience formats and what information they each contain.  Otherwise people could end up comparing graphs that are actually different (for info like clusters) when thinking they are the same.\n\n- \"the original data we downloaded when the files were small enough to be uploaded to GitHub\". What does this mean?  Why does it matter?\n\n- For Figure 3, it says the top 20 most used (should be \"most-used\") data sets but everything after the first 14 only have 1 graph.  It would make more sense just to show those 14 with a comment that the others are all single graphs.\n\n- Figure 5 is not needed to show a single number, especially when it has a different scale to other figures.\n\n- Taxonomy/Classification\n   - \"This work proposes an overarching taxonomy of datasets\", but I feel it is a stretch to call it this.  There are a number of inconsistencies and questions about the categorisation, as described below.  The classification should be made more thorough and precise, or this claim reduced.\n   - Some of the Datasets are classes of graph rather than a single data set.  For example \"Social Networks\" is from 4 data sources.  Does this mean all the papers that use this use all 4 or just 1.  If the later, this makes the presentation of the most-used data sets questionable with Social Networks being number 4. \n   - Similar to this, if the purpose of the archive is for comparison why split entries that refer to the same graphs but the authors mislabelled.\n   - The difference between \"Uniform Benchmark\" and \"Established Network Repository\" is not clear, especially as it related to subset collections.  \n   - Relatedly, Figure 4 shows 6 collections that are a \"subset of another collection\".  Where are these on the GLaDOS website?  This isn't clear.  Similarly the website has a section \"Other\" with 7 datasets, stating \"A few more datasets that did not fit in the preivous categories.\"  (note typo on \"previous\").  Where are these in Figure 4?  All together the categorisation appears arbitrary and inconsistent, and can hardly be called a taxonomy.\n   - The article says \"additional information about the nature of these tags can be found in Section 3 and Section 3.1\" except those sections really don't contain info on the tags other than that tagging was done by two people.  This should be properly explained.\n   - The article says \"Uniform Benchmark datasets\" \"aims to provide a general overview of the performance of a graph layout algorithm by testing on a large amount of graphs varying in size and density, rather than focusing on a specific type of graph\".  It is not clear what \"specific type of graph\" means.  For instance, it could be argued that all graphs in the Storylines dataset are a specific type of graph.\n   - Why categorise the North DAGs and AT&T graphs separately, and then in the North NAGs description, just have See AT&T\".  Given the focus on reproducibility, It would make more sense to have this as an alias for the AT&T dataset and combine them in the listing.\n\n- The KnownCR set lists the \"Known Crossing Number\" tag, but is this value included in the data (graph downloads) for each graph in the dataset?\n\n- For the \"Established Network Repositories\" the article says \"we do not include here any storage of the data\n(which would be redundant) or report statistics  on them\" but provided information (size information, min/max nodes, node distribution and summary charts) would be useful since that allows people to select the appropriate data set.\nIf the issue with generating stats is that they could becoe outdated if the collection is added to, you could say the information was based on a date and then potentially update these as part of the maintenance of GLaDOS.\n\n- The article says \"One more of such collections is Konect. At the time of writing, though, the website for Konect has been down for a while. Both the data and the website are still accessible through web archive—thus we do not consider this a lost collection.\"   Why is the Konect dataset not included in the collection then?\n\n- For a dataset like \"Car Features\" where the features are not known, the dataset is unavailable and the author won't disclose the origin of the data, is there value including it at all, except maybe in a list of papers that fit this category (I imagine there might be many). \n\n- Custom-made Datasets\n   - The final part of the article talks about Custom-made datasets.  It says \"we also found several instances of custom-made datasets\".  From the chart it looks like close to 80 instances.  It would be good to say this and be precise.\n\n   - It also talks about sub-categories of Replicable vs. Reproducible vs non-replicable.  Where does this information appear in the GLaDOS website?  This is not clear.\n\n\n- In Section 4.2 \"Random Generation\"\n  - The article says \"The list of features to take into account to claim that a synthetic graph is comparable to another one would be long, and perhaps out of the scope of this publication. These are just a few examples of what could be relevant:\"  What follows looks like a list produced by GenAI with no explanation of where this came from (at least I got similar result crafting a quick prompt from the text above).  I question what this list contributes to the paper.  If it is to be included, it should be shortened and properly justified. \n  - References should be given for \"Erdős-Rényi\", \"Barabási-Albert\" and also the sentence beginning \"Conversely, the BA model produces scale-free networks with... \"\n\n- In Section 5, the difference between gray and blue dots in Figure 8 is almost impossible to distinguish.  Please use more visually distinct colours or a different mark.\n\n- The future maintainability of the work is unclear. That is, there is no commitment or plan in the article of the future maintainability of the archive as new graph data sets are published.  It would be good to see a plan for this, whether it is the authors or as an open project.  If the later there might be a need to document the processes for maintenance to allow others to update the GLaDOS website.\n\n\n\n\n### Issues with GLaDOS content included in article vs. website\n- The descriptions on the website are clearly hand-authored and are inconsistent in the presented information.  For example most don't list the number of graphs, sometimes the Size information is formatted differently.  It would be useful for all of them to list the number of graphs in the dataset (some are listed in paper, but not on website).  No degree statistics are listed for Storylines (is this because all nodes are degree 1 or 2? No degree statistics are listed for Co-Phylogenetic Trees dataset. The Militarized Interstate Disputes (MID) dataset has no descriptive stats at all.  All these entries should be consistent, so the user of this set can have a reasonable expectation of the available info, even if this is blank or N/A for some entries.  \n- Sometimes under Usage examples each paper lists the authors and years (GraphViz in article) other times just [link] (Graphviz on website, Matrix Market in both article and website). Relatedly, links to papers are formatted inconsistently throughout, for example in the Co-Phylogenetic Trees dataset  it says \"Collected by the authors of “https://almob.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13015-014-0031-3”.\"  It would help to have consistent formatting like with the Author name, and year, like a paper reference, with a clickable hyperlink.  This applies to both the website and the embedded expandable version in the paper.\n- The article makes it clear that all datasets are sourced from the review of literatures, but the GLaDOS website doesn't give any details of where they were sourced, other than the \"Benchmark datasets\" category saying \"These are collections of graphs that have been frequently used in graph drawing papers\" which is then not listed under the other categories.  There should be a sentence or two on the website that explains all datasets came from graph drawing literature.\n- The Enron entry has a typo \"webiste\" in both the article and the GLaDOS website.\n- The Transportation Networks entry has a typo \"feautre\" in the article only.\n\n### Minor typographical issues\n- \"although all the links to it in previous papers are now broken\" -> \"with all the links to it in previous papers now broken\"\n- \"by still documenting what we could find about them\" -> \"by documenting what we could still find about them\"\n- \"with an accent on encouraging efforts towards replicability\" -> \"with an focus on encouraging replicability\" \n- \"Following this process, we tried to track down\" -> \"We used the following process to track down\"\n- \"The chart below shows\" -> \"Figure 1 shows\"\n- \"The following one, instead, shows\" -> \"Figure 2 shows\"\n- \"last 7 years\" Would be better to define the period.\n- \"redistirbution\" -> \"redistribution\"\n- \"This phenomenon, as long as the information\" -> \"This phenomenon, as well as the information\"\n- \"particularly useful when researchers are particularly useful for this task\" -> \"particularly useful for this task\"\n- \"A dataset that is not anymore accessible renders\" -> \"A dataset that is not accessible anymore renders\"\n- \"gaining more and more attention.\" -> \"gaining more attention.\"\n- \"but has found no universal solution yet\" -> \"but has not resulted in a universal solution\"\n\n\n### Openness/Transparency\n\nA long-term-archive provides the code and data for the website, as well as code used for the reconstruction of \"lost\" data sets.  As such, this work is open and people can scrutinise and build on it.\n\n### Submission categories\n\n- [ ] Registered Report\n- [ ] Replication Study\n- [ ] Empirical Research - Quantitative\n- [ ] Empirical Research - Qualitative\n- [ ] Systems or design research\n- [ ] Commentary\n- [x] Systematic Literature Review\n\n### Suggested outcome\n\nMinor revisions: this paper requires some smaller changes, after which I am confident I would be able to endorse it.\n\n\n### Requested changes\n\n- Ensure consistency of the metadata for datasets within the article and on the GLaDOS website, and the describe the process for accuracy.\n\n- Address or explain the inconsistencies/questions about the classification of datasets, and potentially downplay or remove the contribution of a taxonomy.\n\n- Add search/filtering to the GLaDOS website, similar to the article.\n\n- Describe plans for upkeep and maintenance of the GLaDOS archive in the future.\n\n- Explain the properties of different graph download formats and whether they all contain equivalent information.\n\n- Address other minor issues that require explanation or clarification.\n\n### ORCID\n\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0001-5536-7780",

Regular text must have >4.5:1.\n- [ ] Content has non-visual alternatives. All figures have alt text and videos have transcripts. Equations are screen reader accessible.\n- [x] Font sizes for all texts are sufficiently large. Text must not be smaller than 9pt/12px in size. Ideally only minor text is rendered at 9pt (e.g., axis labels) while all other text is larger.\n- [x] Where possible within reason, the article works even if I could not perceive colors. Colors should be augmented with patterns, textures, other visual cues, or tooltips if possible.\n- [ ] The article can be navigated comfortably with a screen reader. There are no unnecessary accessibility elements (e.g., axis ticks and labels) that clutter the screen reader experience.\n\n### Screen reader\n\n- [x] VoiceOver on macOS\n- [ ] VoiceOver on iOS\n- [ ] NVDA on Windows\n- [ ] JAWS on Windows\n- [ ] Not tested with a screen reader (explain below why not)\n\n### Browser\n\n- [x] Safari or other WebKit-based browser\n- [ ] Chrome or other Chromium-based browser\n- [ ] Firefox\n\n### Comments on Perceivable\n\nThe images are all missing alt texts.\n\nSome charts expose elements to the screen reader (here the bars) which are distracting and not useful. Hide them. \n<img width=\"847\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e4575c4-fee5-4991-b158-f903f3eaa33c\" />\n\nPlease disable tooltips for citations because of https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/6500. \n\n### Operable\n\n- [x] If there are interactive elements in the article, they can be operated with a keyboard.\n- [x] If there are interactive elements in the article, there are textual instructions for how to use them or it's reasonable to assume that it's clear how to use them.\n- [x] When navigating over the article with a keyboard, the focus indicator is always visible.\n- [x] Interactions that work with a mouse also work on a touch screen (unless explicitly called out).\n\n### Comments on Operable\n\nAll good\n\n### Understandable\n\n- [x] All charts have a title and a description.\n- [x] Changes in animated or interactive elements are easy to follow.\n- [x] All axes have clear labels (either explicit or implicitly given the context).\n- [x] There are legends for all charts that need them.\n\n### Comments on Understandable\n\nAll good\n\n### Robust\n\n- [x] All buttons use the `button` tag.\n- [x] Headings, paragraphs, and figures are tagged correctly.\n\n### Comments on Robust\n\nAll good\n\n### Assistive\n\n- [x] The data density of all charts is appropriate. Use clustering or other data reduction techniques if elements compete for space but explain the method.\n- [x] Navigation and interaction feels intuitive with all interaction methods (mouse, keyboard, touch).\n- [x] All visually apparent features and relationships are described.\n- [x] Formatting makes values human-readable. Use , or space to separate thousands. Align numbers to the right. Use the smallest, appropriate number of significant digits.\n\n### Comments on Assistive\n\nAll good.\n\n### Flexible\n\n- [x] The article is readable on a phone.\n- [x] The article can be zoomed and font-sizes change appropriately. The layout of the page does not break when zooming in or changing the font size (e.g., using CMD + or CMD - on macOS).\n- [x] Long animations (if they exist) can be paused or stopped. Animations should be videos, not GIFs as they cannot be paused.\n- [x] Style and charts use a consistent and familiar design (fonts, colors, etc). Interaction defaults should be consistent for all interactive elements.\n\n### Comments on Flexible\n\nAll good. \n\n### ORCID\n\n0000-0002-3110-1053",

			"body": "### Conflicts of interest\n\n- [x] I declare that I have no known conflicts of interest with the authors.\n\n### Reviewed version\n\nf41e831\n\n### Review\n\nThis paper presents GLADOS, an extensive webpage and archive for a large collection of popular graph drawing datasets. Additionally, the authors provide more information in the form of e.g. documentation, code and unified graph data format. The paper itself describes the problem of reproducibility in science and vanishing datasets, and offers a solution of an overarching taxonomy of datasets and their features. GLADOS is easy enough to explore so that any experienced an inexperienced user should be able to view existing datasets, where they have been used, their classifications, and their attributes.\n\nThe paper documents a massive collaborative effort to not just collect but also categorize the most popular graph drawing datasets used in recent years. Moreover, the authors put in a lot of effort to acquire datasets that were lost by either reproducing them (with the instructions given in their respective papers) or by contacting the author for each lost dataset. There are a few limitations, which have also been identified by the authors themselves, such as the limited number of venues and the large bias towards datasets used in recent years. However, the paper is strong enough to hold substantial merit irrespective of these limitations. The paper therefore does not need major revising but could provide a few more arguments on their limitations.\n\n**Strengths**\n\n(S1) Data collection\nBy far, the data collection is the strongest aspect of the paper. Not only is the accumulated collection of datasets incredibly vast, it has also been categorized and described to help researchers with making choices on what datasets to use for their future works. This collection will make future experiments with newly proposed graph drawing algorithms much more comparable as it allows researchers to have access to standard benchmark datasets.\n\n(S2) Extensive Data Processing and Gathering\nNext to collecting the publicly available datasets from various sources, the authors also attempted to recreate datasets of papers according to the papers' specifications. Furthermore, the authors have made all collected graphs in the datasets available in three commonly-used formats. \n\n(S3) Archive\nAs the authors themselves noted, direct access to datasets and even papers occasionally vanish, making it impossible to reproduce research and compare newer techniques with existing ones. To counter this problem, the authors establish a long-term archive on the Open Science Framework, ensuring the preservation and accessibility of the collected datasets.\n\n**Weakness**\n\n(W1) Maintenance and Future Datasets\nWhile the creation of a long-term archive ensures its existence for a long period of time, the maintenance of the webpage and the archive has not been described in the paper. I am particularly interested in whether the authors considered a roadmap or some sort of protocol for including newer datasets that will be released in future works, i.e. how can these datasets be added to the collection?\n\n(W2) The information on the popularity of the datasets is not integrated in the tag-filtered navigation filtering system. In Section 4.1 the authors do mention for each dataset the original paper and example papers in which the dataset is used; on top of that, Figure 8 displays the frequency of a dataset being used in a paper over time. However, it would be useful to have information on the popularity readily available in the filtering system to quickly observe which datasets are more commonly used.\n\n(W3) As mentioned by the authors themselves, the selection of venues limited the total number of papers and datasets included in the collection. I know for a fact that there are a handful of GD papers posted in other venues in which other datasets were reused and created for the purpose of GD algorithms e.g. see CoRe-GD of ICLR (https://openreview.net/forum?id=vtyasLn4RM). While the aforementioned example paper could (probably) still be found by the collection process described in Section 3, I fear that other papers that focus more on the algorithmic part and were therefore published in other venues might have been overlooked. While the authors mention that the collection is not comprehensive but a starting point, they do not mention how they or others might extend this work or could continue the upkeep of collecting datasets.\n\n(W4) The collection process simply mentions that only papers were included that were cited more than 4 times in the last 6 years of graph drawing. While I do understand the need for setting some inclusion criterion, and I might be nit-picky here, why was this criterion set to 4 citations? I would imagine that this, for instance, would include less relevant papers that were only cited 5 times in the last 20 years and would exclude newly released papers that might be more relevant.\n\nMinor notes:\nSection 3, 2nd paragraph, 2nd to last sentence: 'redistirbution'\nSection 3.1, 1st paragraph, last sentence: 'replicablility'\n\nReviewer note: I have seen similar issues arise in the field of Dimensionality Reduction (DR). To my knowledge, a work similar to GLADOS for DR does not exist. The authors could raise this as a potential future work for the DR community to take inspiration from GLADOS.\n\n**Final Recommendation**\nI believe this paper is a strong and especially useful contribution to the field of Graph Drawing. With some minor modifications to the webpage and some additional clarity on the upkeep, I believe this paper will be a valuable contribution to the Journal of Visualization.\n\n### Openness/Transparency\n\n\n\n**Openness/Transparency**\nAs described in the Strengths section of my review, the paper at hand is incredibly open and transparent. The data processing has been explained in detail and all of the datasets have been made publicly available in multiple formats. \n\n\n\n### Submission categories\n\n- [ ] Registered Report\n- [ ] Replication Study\n- [ ] Empirical Research - Quantitative\n- [ ] Empirical Research - Qualitative\n- [ ] Systems or design research\n- [ ] Commentary\n- [x] Systematic Literature Review\n\n### Suggested outcome\n\nMinor revisions: this paper requires some smaller changes, after which I am confident I would be able to endorse it.\n\n\n### Requested changes\n\n- Additional Information on the Upkeep: As mentioned in (W1), I believe that it would be worthwhile describing how other researchers could contribute to the collection in the future, as well as how GLADOS will be maintained.\n- Improve the Functionality of the Filtering System: As mentioned in (W2), the inclusion of popularity of a dataset will help researchers in finding the benchmark dataset(s) that are more commonly used for the classes described in the filtering system.\n\n### ORCID\n\n_No response_",

			"body": "### Conflicts of interest\n\n- [x] I declare that I have no known conflicts of interest with the authors.\n\n### Reviewed version\n\n f41e831\n\n### Review\n\nThe paper presents a well-organized and valuable resource for benchmarking graph layout algorithms, addressing the need for standardized datasets. The authors compile existing datasets, reconstruct lost ones, and categorize them for easy access. Their work enhances reproducibility in graph visualization research and helps ensure that datasets remain accessible for future studies.\n\n**Strengths**\n\n- Comprehensive Dataset Collection – The authors have systematically gathered and archived datasets from 196 papers, ensuring their long-term availability. This extensive effort makes it easier for researchers to access past datasets without struggling to track them down.\n- Reproducibility and Accessibility – The datasets are stored on the Open Science Framework (OSF) and made available in multiple formats (JSON, GraphML, GEXF, GML), which increases usability for a broad range of researchers and practitioners.\n- A Structured Taxonomy – The categorization of datasets (Uniform Benchmark, Established Network Repository, etc.) provides a clear and useful way to navigate and select relevant datasets based on specific research needs.\n- Replicability Focus – The study directly addresses the issue of “link rot” by documenting and preserving datasets that were previously inaccessible. This is a major step toward improving research sustainability in the field.\n- Technical Implementation – The paper provides clear details on the data collection process, dataset characteristics, and visualization tools, demonstrating a rigorous and thoughtful approach.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\n- Usability and Search Functionality – While the Graph Layout Benchmark Datasets is a great idea, I feel that an advanced search function—or even a simple keyword-based search—would greatly improve usability for practitioners. This would make finding appropriate datasets much easier and feels like a missed opportunity.\n- Data Consistency Verification – There is no clear mention of how data consistency was verified across different sources. Since datasets come from various papers, it would be useful to know what steps were taken to ensure accuracy and reliability.\n- Potential Bias in Dataset Selection – The paper does not clarify whether there were any biases in how datasets were selected or reconstructed. A brief discussion on this would strengthen the transparency of the work.\n\n**Final Recommendation**\n\nAlthough this paper does not follow the structure of a conventional research paper and feels more like a dataset report, I believe it is a strong and valuable contribution to the field. The effort to compile, organize, and preserve graph layout benchmark datasets is highly relevant and beneficial for researchers working in graph visualization.\n\nWith minor revisions addressing usability improvements, data verification methods, and dataset selection biases, I believe this paper would be well-suited for publication in the Journal of Visualization and Interaction.\n\n### Openness/Transparency\n\nThe paper is very open and transparent. The datasets are publicly available on OSF in multiple formats, making them easy to use. The data collection process is well explained, and the authors share their code on GitHub, helping others build on their work.\n\nOne small improvement could be clearer details on how they checked data accuracy and any biases in dataset selection. But overall, this work is easy to use and a great resource for future research.\n\n### Submission categories\n\n- [ ] Registered Report\n- [ ] Replication Study\n- [ ] Empirical Research - Quantitative\n- [ ] Empirical Research - Qualitative\n- [ ] Systems or design research\n- [ ] Commentary\n- [x] Systematic Literature Review\n\n### Suggested outcome\n\nMinor revisions: this paper requires some smaller changes, after which I am confident I would be able to endorse it.\n\n\n### Requested changes\n\n- Improve Search Functionality of the Web Page (if applicable) – The dataset collection is valuable, but adding a search feature (even a basic keyword-based one) would make it much easier for researchers to find relevant datasets.\n- Clarify Data Consistency Checks – There is no clear mention of how the authors ensured data accuracy and consistency across different sources. A brief explanation would strengthen transparency.\n- Discuss Potential Bias in Dataset Selection – Since some datasets were reconstructed, it would help to include a short note on how the selection process might introduce bias and what was done to minimize this.\n\n### ORCID\n\n0000-0001-6745-4398",

			"body": "@mlisnic, @picorana will submit a registration for this.\r\n\r\nBelow is some food for thought I may write up as a blog post.\r\n\r\nA registration sounds good to me in this case because there is no substantial downside if we need OSF to delete the registration later and upload a new one. \r\n\r\nBut when the correct timestamp is essential, such as a preregistration, I'm getting more wary about registering many files that weren't as closely manually checked for data that shouldn't be included. It is more difficult to go back and remove or fix any incorrectly included data, e.g., PII, confidential information, or breaks of anonymity.\r\n\r\nWorking with OSF to get the data removed or cleaned is challenging. They are helpful when asked and have manual processes for fixing the issues, but they are error-prone.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of that problem.\r\n\r\nWe submitted our [Relational Diagrams](https://dunne.dev/pubs/Gatterbauer2024ReasonableEffectiveness/) paper to SIGMOD, including an anonymous link to a controlled experiment preregistration at https://osf.io/4zpsk/. We took great care to avoid revealing our author names, institution, or project name because SIGMOD takes anonymity in supplemental materials extremely seriously. \r\n\r\nHowever, we made two mistakes in the files we included along with the registration document which could identify us and get our paper desk rejected:\r\n1. One PDF file included my co-author's name in the PDF metadata, automatically included in the PDF generated by PowerPoint.\r\n2. One Markdown file included the name Relational Diagrams in a title, which was already publicly known as the name of our project from a previous preprint, submissions, and presentations. We had elsewhere used a placeholder name.\r\n\r\nI emailed OSF, asking them to replace those files with cleaned versions that differed only in that content, not in any semantics. OSF offered to delete our registration and let us submit a new one with a new timestamp. Unfortunately, we have already collected the data, ran our analysis (see https://osf.io/f2xe3), and submitted the paper with a link to our current preregistration. Starting a new preregistration with a current timestamp would defeat the point of registering before collecting data.\r\n\r\nOSF replaced the files for us. However, the replacement was only partially correct. The PDF had the correct metadata, both for the web PDF viewer and the file if you download it. However, the Markdown file still had our original title on the web viewer, even if I hard refreshed the page or opened the anonymous link in a private browsing instance. The download link had the corrected version, though. In both cases, the download filename and extension were changed to some long, unique ID.\r\n\r\nI wrote to OSF about these issues. They fixed it partially. The OSF web page showed the old version in the web viewer if I used the direct link, even when logging in on a new private browsing instance. But the updated version showed when I used the anonymous peer review link! For both files, the download filename and extension were still changed.\r\n\r\nWe left the remaining problems as-is because they didn't affect our submission, as everything through the anonymous link worked. But let this serve as a warning to others about registering more than necessary :-).",

We unfortunately don't support this usage.\r\n\r\nand then:\r\n\r\n> I agree, but investigate the source code of observable's JS framework yourself and you'll come to the same conclusion about the amount of changes we'd have to make.\r\n\r\nSo, they seem to not support at all running OJS offline. A lot of my figures are made with OJS though. \r\nI am not sure of what I should do. I am bringing this to your attention because I think it should be known that Quarto + OJS can not be used if an offline version of the paper is required. Or perhaps there is something that I am missing - please let me know if you have any relevant insight.",

Some example workflow files:\r\n         - [Quarto](https://github.com/journalovi/jovi-template-quarto/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml)\r\n         - [Idyll](https://github.com/journalovi/2024-Cashman-PAC-learning-game/blob/master/.github/workflows/publish.yml) - this template can be easily adapted for other workflows that use custom tools for building, e.g. npm or yarn, by swapping out the `npm` commands and ensuring the correct output folder is copied to the `gh-pages` branch in the last step.\r\n      - [x] Go to **Settings -> Pages**:\r\n         - [x] Set \"Source\" to \"Deploy from a branch\"\r\n         - [x] Set \"Branch\" to \"gh-pages\"\r\n         - [x] Set the folder to \"/\"\r\n      - [ ] Verify the compilation works. On the repo page, go to Actions and click on the \"XXX Publish\" (XXX = Quarto/Idyll/etc) workflow on the left, then click Run Workflow and run it.\r\n   - [x] Verify that the \"pages build and deployment\" action is successful.\r\n   - [x] Check that the live version of the article is visible at http://www.journalovi.org/20XX-YY-ZZ (replace the last part with the repo name).\r\n- [ ] Ensure the paper contains a notice infobox at the top that the paper is under review and that the repository links in the notice are correct (by replacing the `20xx-repo-name` part with the repository name).\r\n\r\n   In Quarto this looks like:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   ::: {.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\r\n   ## Under Review {.unnumbered}\r\n   This paper is [under review](https://www.journalovi.org/under-review.html) on the experimental\r\n   track of the [Journal of Visualization and Interaction](https://www.journalovi.org/).\r\n   See the [reviews](https://github.com/journalovi/20xx-repo-name/issues?q=label%3Areview) and\r\n   [issues](https://github.com/journalovi/20xx-repo-name/issues) for this paper.\r\n   :::\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   In HTML this could be:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   <p style=\"border-left: 5px solid #ff4136; border-right: 1px solid #dee2e6; border-top: 1px solid #dee2e6; border-bottom: 1px solid #dee2e6; border-radius: 6px; padding: 0.75em 1em;\">\r\n   <strong>Under Review:</strong> This paper is <a href=\"https://www.journalovi.org/under-review.html\">under review</a>\r\n   on the experimental track of the <a href=\"https://www.journalovi.org/\">Journal of Visualization and Interaction</a>.\r\n   See the <a href=\"https://github.com/journalovi/20xx-repo-name/issues?q=label%3Areview\">reviews</a> and\r\n   <a href=\"https://github.com/journalovi/20xx-repo-name/issues\">issues</a> for this paper.\r\n   </p>\r\n   ```\r\n   - [x] In the info box, ensure “20xx-repo-name” is replaced with the name of the repository so that the links point to the appropriate pages on Github.\r\n   - [x] Check that the live version of the paper now has the infobox in it with the correct links. You may need to go to the Actions page to check that the build process has completed, then go back to the live paper URL. You might need to reload the article without cache (In Chrome: Cmd + Shift + R (Mac) or Ctrl+ Shift + R (Windows)).\r\n- [x] Compare the paper with the authors’ compiled version that the authors submitted. Sample the figures and interactive elements to see if they are present and work in the same way.\r\n- [ ] Check that the article works locally without an internet connection:\r\n   - [ ] Check out the repo and switch to whatever branch serves the site (e.g. `main` or `master` for sites without compilation, `gh-pages` for sites with compilation).\r\n   - [ ] #2\n         \r\n      ```sh\r\n      python -m http.server\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n      When loading, keep the dev console open and note any resources that are unable to load. Sample the figures and interactive elements to see if they are present and work in the same way. If any are missing, either attempt to fix or prepare a list for the authors of resources they will need to ensure are included in their repository rather than loaded over the network. In quarto, it may be helpful to add (if it is not there already):\r\n\r\n      ```yaml\r\n      format:\r\n        html:\r\n          embed-resources: true\r\n          self-contained-math: true\r\n          html-math-method: katex\r\n      ```\r\n- [x] From the [main repo page](../), click the settings gear icon next to \"About\" on the right. (If you cannot see the “About” section, make your web browser window wider.)\r\n   - [x] Under \"Description\" enter \"UNDER REVIEW\"\r\n   - [x] Under \"Website\" tick \"Use Your Github Pages Website\".\r\n   - [x] Click “Save changes”\r\n- [x] Edit README.md and add the following at the very top:\r\n   ````\r\n   ```diff\r\n   !
