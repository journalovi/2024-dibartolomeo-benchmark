# Datasets in use

The following chart shows how many times we found a dataset being used in the papers we collected. It excludes custom edits to the datasets, which are discussed later in this document.

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
//| fig-cap: "This barchart shows, for the top 20 most used datasets, the number of times a dataset was used in collected papers."
//| fig-alt: "A barchart showing the number of times a dataset was used in the papers in our survey.

    let d = []
    let allbenchmarkdatasets = [...new Set(literature.map(l => l["Dataset tag relations"].split("(")[0].trim()))].filter(a => a != "")
  
    allbenchmarkdatasets = allbenchmarkdatasets.filter(b => !b.includes("Custom"))
    allbenchmarkdatasets = allbenchmarkdatasets.slice(0, 20)

        ]
  })
}
```

In the data we collected, the most used dataset is Rome-Lib, followed by assorted collaboration networks (which in many cases refers to datasets of academic collaborations such as dblp or vispubdata). The third most used dataset is from C.Walshaw - it is important to note that the Walshaw dataset is available as part of other collections - for instance, its graphs are found in SNAP. However, during the collection process, we preferred giving precedence to how the authors reported their own information. Thus, if the authors claimed the data was from the Walshaw collection, we reported it as such.

<!-- We deem the popularity of Rome-Lib to be due to its simplicity, versatility, and most importantly the fact that it is linked on graphdrawing.org and offered as a benchmark dataset there. This is also true for the North DAGs. -->

For each of the datasets collected as part of our process, we conducted a brief analysis of their contents. Where possible, the analysis includes information about the number of nodes per graph, the source of the dataset, which papers have used the dataset and what graph features they took into account. 

In the following sections, the reader will find details about the classifications and datasets in detail. Each dataset gets a dedicated, collapsible section, that contains the following information:

- A brief summary description of the dataset, the reasons for its popularity, and notes about how it was created or collected.
- Metadata containing:
  - The original source of the dataset.
  - Links to download the dataset in different formats, provided from our OSF repository.
  - The size of the dataset.
  - The original paper where the dataset was first introduced.
  - A list of papers that have used the dataset, together with what features their graph layout algorithm handles.
- Charts illustrating node and edge count distribution through the dataset, mean and maximum distribution.
- Descriptions of the datasets lifted directly from the literature, which can help shine light on the content and properties of the dataset, how it was used in previous literature, or how it originated.
- Figures collected from the literature, such as visualizations of the graphs, or other relevant information. The visualizations can help a reader looking for a specific type of graph to quickly identify if the dataset is relevant to their research.

## Classification of the Datasets

The datasets we collected are divided in different categories: the categorization we used is the same as the one used in @dibartolomeo2024evaluating. The following is a brief explanation of the categories used, which are explained in deeper detail in each one of the corresponding chapters.

- **Uniform Benchmark (@sec-uniform-benchmark-datasets):** Datasets that are standalone widely used collections of graphs featuring uniform characteristics - usually simple, generic graphs, often used in evaluations that run over thousands of graphs to report average completion times, or other experiments where the reported metrics are usually aggregated.
- **Established Network Repository (@sec-established-network-repositories):** A collection of individual, or groups of graphs, part of a larger repository. These datasets are often used in evaluations that require a diverse set of graphs, or when the evaluation is focused on a specific type of graph. These collections usually also report on graphs with their own statistics or visualizations, providing a summary of the dataset. This category also includes **Subsets (@sec-subsets)**.
- **Single Graphs (@sec-single-graphs):** The data used is comprised of one individual graph, which often contains special characteristics making it particularly relevant for the evaluation at hand. 
- **Aggregate Collections (@sec-aggregate-collections):** Collections of graphs focusing on one specific context (such as forum posts, or airline routes) due to the given context having a special set of features that is relevant for a graph layout algorithm. 

The type of collection informs various aspects of an evaluation, such as which results are relevant to report. For this discussion, we refer to @dibartolomeo2024evaluating, where the authors link the type of collection in the context of graph layout evaluations.

The following visualization shows the amount of datasets we collected per category:

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
{ 
  let d = []
  
  let collection_type = benchmark_datasets.map(a => a["Type of Collection"]);

  for (let c of [... new Set(collection_type)]){
    if (c == "Skip" || c == "Missed it") continue;
    let count = collection_type.filter(a => a == c).length;
    if (c.includes("No report")) c = "Established Network Repository";
    if (c.includes("Lost")) continue;
    d.push({"collection_type": c, "count": count})
  }
  
  return Plot.plot({
    color: {
      scheme: "Tableau10" 
    },
    marks: [
      Plot.barX(d, {x: "count", y: "collection_type", fill: "collection_type", inset: 2, sort: {y: "x", reverse: true}}),
      Plot.axisY({label: null, lineWidth: 12, marginLeft: 150}),
    ]
  })
}
```

Unfortunately, some of the datasets used in layout algorithm evaluations are not accessible anymore. Where possible, we still collected and reported all the information contained in the papers about the datasets, so that we can conserve an idea of what they contained. This phenomenon, as long as the information we could collect, is discussed in **Lost and Unavailable Datasets (@sec-lost)**.

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
{ 
  let d = []
  
  let collection_type = benchmark_datasets.map(a => a["Type of Collection"]);

  for (let c of [... new Set(collection_type)]){
    if (c == "Skip" || c == "Missed it") continue;
    let count = collection_type.filter(a => a == c).length;
    if (c.includes("No report")) c = "Established Network Repository";
    if (!c.includes("Lost")) continue;
    d.push({"collection_type": c, "count": count})
  }
  
  return Plot.plot({
    color: {
      scheme: "PiYg" 
    },
    marks: [
      Plot.barX(d, {x: "count", y: "collection_type", fill: "collection_type", inset: 2, sort: {y: "x", reverse: true}}),
      Plot.axisY({label: null, lineWidth: 12, marginLeft: 150}),
    ]
  })
}
```

Finally, we include a discussion on **Custom-made Datasets (@sec-custom-made-datasets)**, synthetically generated datasets for the purpose of an experiment. 

Each dataset also contains a number of graph features specific to the graphs contained in it. Authors might want to use a dataset that contains a specific feature, such as a graph with a high number of nodes, or a graph with a specific structure. The following interactive filtering systems allows for filtering of datasets (and papers) based on the features they contain.

{{< include /chapters/interactive_filtering.qmd >}}

### Uniform Benchmark datasets {#sec-uniform-benchmark-datasets}

**Uniform Benchmark** datasets are standalone widely used collections of graphs featuring uniform characteristics - usually simple, generic graphs, often used in evaluations that run over thousands of graphs to report average completion times, or other experiments where the reported metrics are usually aggregated.

Differently from the collections presented later in this section, an experiment that uses an Uniform Benchmark dataset aims to provide a general overview of the performance of a graph layout algorithm by testing on a large amount of graphs varying in size and density, rather than focusing on a specific type of graph.

The first of these collapsible sections is shown already expanded, to give an example of the content that can be found in each of them. The content is generated dynamically based on the data we collected. 

<!-- [http://graphdrawing.org describes it as: “Test suites of directed and undirected graphs from the http://www.dia.uniroma3.it/~gdt/ homepage (also known as the Rome Graphs)”.  -->

<!-- ,  and it is used in a large number of papers: [@Buchheim2008] [@chimani2010] [@chimani2006] [@diBartolomeo2022b] [@Clancy2019] [@DiBattista1997b] [@chimani2016b] [@Chimani2008] [@Bekos2018] [@Demel2018] [@Heinsohn2018] [@Kindermann2018] [@chimani2016] [@Chimani2012] [@Gansner2006] [@Gutwenger2004] [@klammler2018] [@Niedermann2020] [@Giovannangeli2021] [@Chimani2021]. -->

<a name="Rome-Lib"></a>

::: {.callout-note title="Rome-Lib" collapse=false appearance="minimal"}

Rome-Lib is, as previously discussed, the most common benchmark dataset, due to its already established popularity, its ease of use and access, and the many properties that are already known about it. 
It was first introduced in [@DiBattista1997b] and presented in their paper ”An experimental comparison of four graph drawing algorithms”. Mostly “real” networks such as software companies, government, software engineering books, database design, and journal articles on visualization. Originally sent as an extended abstract to Computational Geometry in 1995 [@DiBattista1995]. 
It contains exclusively <a href="#generic"><span class="pill-tag pill_color_generic">generic</span></a>graphs (e.g., undirected, non-layered, without pre-established clusters...), although some of the research that uses it enhances with additional attributes (such as performing a rank assignment step). 
Information about optimal crossings can be found as part of [WebCompute](#WebCompute).

#### Statistics

#### Descriptions from Literature

From “[A branch-and-cut approach to the crossing number problem](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.disopt.2007.05.006)”:

> To test the performance of our new algorithm, we used a benchmark set of graphs of the University of Rome III, introduced in [11]. The set contains 11 389 graphs that consist of 10 to 100 nodes and 9 to 158 edges. These graphs were generated from a core set of 112 “real life” graphs used in database design and software engineering applications. Most of the graphs are sparse, which is a common property in most application areas of automatic graph drawing. The average ratio between the number of edges and the number of nodes of the graphs from the benchmark set is about 1.35.

From “[Layer-free upward crossing minimization](https://doi.org/10.1145/1671970.1671975)”:

> The Rome graphs [Di Battista et al. 1997] are a widely used benchmark set in graph drawing, obtained from a basic set of 112 real-world graphs. It contains 11,528 instances with 10 through 100 nodes and 9 through 158 edges. Although the graphs are originally undirected, they have been used as directed graphs—by artificially directing the edges according to the node order given in the input files—for showing the performance of the mixed-upward planarization approach [Eiglsperger et al. 2003]. In this case, all edges are directed and the graphs are acyclic; hence, the mixed-upward planarization approach turns into an upward planarization method.

From “[A New Approach to Exact Crossing Minimization](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-87744-8_24)”:

> We say graphs are trivial, if they are planar or if the heuristic achieves a planarization with only one crossing, as in these cases we need not prove optimality. The Rome library contains 7172 non-trivial graphs.

From “[An Experimental Comparison of Four Graph Drawing Algorithms](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0925-7721(96)00005-3)”

> Our test graph generation strategy is as follows. First, we have focused on the important application area of database and software visualization, where Entity-Relationship diagrams and Data-Flow diagrams are usually displayed with orthogonal drawings. Second, we have collected 112 "real life" graphs with number of vertices between 10 and 100, from now on called core graphs, from the following sources:

> • 54% of the graphs have been obtained from major Italian software companies (especially from Database Informatica) and large government organization (including the Italian Internal Revenue Service and the Italian National Advisory Council for Computer Applications in the Government (Autorita’ per l'Informatica nella Pubblica Amministrazione));
• 33% of the graphs were taken from well-known reference books in software engineering [18] and database design [1], and from journal articles on software visualization in the recent issues of Information Systems and the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering;
• 13% of the graphs were extracted from theses in software and database visualization written by students at the University of Rome "La Sapienza".

> Our approach is based on the following scheme. We defined several primitive operations for updating graphs, which correspond to the typical operations performed by designers of Entity-Relationship and Data-Flow Diagrams, and attributed a certain probability to each of them. More specifically, the updating primitives we have used are the following: InsertEdge, which inserts a new edge between two existing vertices; DeleteEdge, which deletes an existing edge; InsertVertex, which splits an existing edge into two edges by inserting a new vertex; DeleteVertex, which deletes a vertex and all its incident edges; and MakeVertex, which creates a new vertex and connects it to a subset of vertices. The test graphs were then generated in several iterations starting from the core graphs by applying random sequences of operations with a "genetic" mechanism. Namely, at each iteration a new set of test graphs was obtained by applying a random sequence of operations to the current test set. Each new graph was then evaluated for "suitability", and those found not suitable were discarded. The probability of each primitive operation was varied at the end of each iteration. The evaluation of the suitability of the generated graphs was conducted using both objective and subjective analyses. The objective analysis consisted of determining whether the new graph had similar structural properties with respect to the core graph it was derived from. We have taken into account parameters like the average ratio between number of vertices and number of edges and the average number of biconnected components. The subjective analysis consisted in a visual inspection of the new graph and an assessment by expert users of Entity-Relationship and Data-Flow diagrams of its similarity to a "real-life" diagram. For obvious reasons, the subjective analysis has been done on a randomly selected subset of the graphs.

#### Descriptions from Literature

From “[Drawing Directed Acyclic Graphs: An Experimental Study](https://doi.org/10.1142/s0218195900000358)”:

> The experimental study was performed on two different sets of DAGs, both with a strong connection to "real-life" applications. We considered two typical contexts where DAGs play a fundamental role, namely software engineering and project planning.

> The first set of test DAGs are what we call the North DAGs. They are obtained from a collection of directed graphs [28], that North collected at AT\&T Bell Labs by running for two years *Draw DAG*, an e-mail graph drawing service that accepts directed graphs formatted as e-mail messages and returns messages with the corresponding drawings [27].

> Originally, the North DAGs consisted of 5114 directed graphs, whose number of vertices varied in the range *1 … 7602*. However, the density of the directed graphs with a number of vertices that did not fall in the range *10 … 100* was very low (see also the statistics in [28]); since such directed graphs represent a very sparse statistical population we decided to discard them. Then we noted that many directed graphs were isomorphic; since the vertices of the directed graphs have labels associated with them, the problem is tractable. For each isomorphism class, we kept only one representative directed graph. Also, we deleted the directed graphs where subgraphs were specified as clusters, to be drawn in their own distinct rectangular region of the layout, because constrained algorithms are beyond the scope of this study. This filtering left us with 1277 directed graphs.

> Still, 491 directed graphs were not connected and this was a problem for running algorithms implemented in *G D W* (they assume input directed graphs to be connected). Instead of discarding the directed graphs, we followed a more practical approach, by randomly adding a minimum set of directed edges that makes each directed graph connected. Finally, we made the directed graph acyclic, where necessary, by applying some heuristics for inverting the direction of a small subset of edges.

> We then ran a first set of experiments and produced the statistics by grouping the DAGs by number of vertices. Although the comparison among the algorithms looked consistent (the produced plots never oddly overlapped), each single plot was not satisfactory, because it showed peaks and valleys. We went back to study the test suite and observed that grouping them by number of vertices was not the best approach. In fact, the North DAGs come from very heterogeneous sources, mainly representing different phases of various software engineering projects; as a result, directed graphs with more or less the same number of vertices may be either very dense or very sparse.

> Since most of the analyzed quality measures strongly depend on the number of edges of the DAG (e.g. area, number of bends, and number of crossings), we decided that a better approach was to group the DAGs by number of edges. After some tests, we clustered the DAGs into nine groups, each with at least 40 DAGs, so that the number of edges in the DAGs belonging to group *i, 1 ≤ i ≤ 9*, is in the range *10 i … 10 i+9* (see Fig. 3). The resulting test suite consists of 1158 DAGs, each with edges in the range *10 … 99*.

A very common problem in graph drawing is approximating or computing the exact **crossing number** of a graph. 
The datasets listed below are particularly useful when researchers are particularly useful for this task, as they contain graphs with known crossing numbers, so that other algorithms' results can be tested against them. 

<a name="KnownCR"></a>

::: {.callout-note title="KnownCR" collapse=true collapse-id="KnownCR" appearance="minimal"}

**KnownCR** is a collection of graphs with known crossing numbers, and it is used to test the performance of algorithms that approximate the crossing number of a graph. The dataset is used in papers that aim to approximate the crossing number of a graph, and it is used to compare the results of the approximation algorithms to the known crossing numbers of the graphs.
A good resource for this is also the survey provided by [@Clancy2019ASO].
The graphs themselves do not appear to exist online elsewhere, but the method by which they can be created is fully described in [@gutwenger_phd].

#### Description from Literature

From “[An effective crossing minimisation heuristic based on star insertion](https://dx.doi.org/10.7155/jgaa.00487)”:

> KnownCR graphs- these are a set of instances containing between 9 and 250 vertices, first collected by Gutwenger [22], which can be further partitioned into four families of graphs as follows:
> $C_i \times C_j$: The Cartesian product of the cycle on $i$ vertices with the cycle on $j$ vertices. The instances contain graphs with $3 \leq i \leq 7$ and $j \geq i$ such that $ij \leq 250$.
> $G_i \times P_j$: The Cartesian product of the path on $j+1$ vertices with one of the 21 non-isomorphic connected graphs on 5 vertices, where $i$ denotes which of the 21. The instances contain graphs with $3 \leq j \leq 49$.
> $G_i \times C_j$: The Cartesian product of the cycle on $j$ vertices with one of the 21 non-isomorphic connected graphs on 5 vertices, where $i$ denotes which of the 21.

From *An effective crossing minimisation heuristic based on star insertion,* “KnownCR graphs- these are a set of instances containing between 9 and 250 vertices, first collected by Gutwenger [22], which can be further partitioned into four families of graphs as follows:

- Ci ×Cj: the Cartesian product of the cycle on i vertices with the cycle on j vertices. The instances contain graphs with 3 ≤ i ≤ 7 and j ≥i such that ij ≤ 250.
- Gi×Pj: the cartesian product of the path on j+1 vertices with one of the 21 non-isomorphic connected graphs on 5 vertices, where i denotes which of the 21. The instances contain graphs with 3 ≤ j ≤ 49.
- Gi ×Cj: the cartesian product of the cycle on j vertices with one of the 21 non-isomorphic connected graphs on 5 vertices, where i denotes which of the 21. The crossing number of these graphs are only known for some of the Gi and only these cases are included. The instances contain graphs with 3 ≤ j ≤ 50

**Complete graphs** refers to a generic collection of graphs that are fully connected, i.e., each node is connected to every other node, up to any number of nodes that are needed for the purpose of the experiment. 
The linked dataset includes both the complete graphs $K_n$ for $5≤n≤50$ and the complete bipartite graphs $K_{n_1,n_2}$ for $5≤n1,n2≤40$. Crossing number is conjectured for most of these, and while not proven, we found these used in papers to validate minimum crossing numbers. We also note that the papers in our literature review did not provide example figures.

#### Descriptions from Literature

From “[An effective crossing minimisation heuristic based on star insertion](https://doi.org/10.7155/jgaa.00487)”:

> **Complete graphs** - Although the crossing number of the complete graph $K_n$ is not known for for $n ≥ 13$, the value is conjectured, and typically assumed to be correct. We compare the nine combinations of schemes to see how close to the conjectured value each of them is able to get, for various sizes of complete graphs up to $n = 50$. We indicate how many crossings are obtained after the initial embedding, as well as at the conclusion of the heuristic. We also provide the runtimes, again separated into time spent producing the initial embedding, and time spent in the main loop of the heuristic.

> **Complete bipartite graphs** - Much like the complete graphs, the crossing number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{n1,n2}$ is only known in general for $n_1 ≤ 6$, but the value is conjectured and typically assumed to be correct. Again, we compare the nine combinations of schemes to see how close to the conjectured value they can get for values up to $n_1,n_2 = 40$, and report the same data as for the Complete graphs.

> The crossing number of the complete graph $K_n$ is conjectured (e.g. see Guy [25]) to be equal to
$H(n) := 1/4 \left\lfloor n/2\right\rfloor \left\lfloor (n − 1)/2\right\rfloor \left\lfloor(n − 2)/2\right\rfloor \left\lfloor (n − 3)/2\right\rfloor$.
Although this conjecture is widely believed to be correct, it has only been confirmed for $n ≤ 12$ despite considerable effort to extend the results further [30]. We ran the graphs $K_n$ for $5 ≤ n ≤ 50$. Each graph was run with 100 random permutations and the minimum found solution was compared to $H(n)$ by computing the percent relative deviation from $H(n)$…
For these graphs, we observe that when $n$ was odd, every scheme combination was able to obtain a drawing with $H(n)$ crossings. However, when $n$ was even, each scheme reached a value which was usually very close but not equal to $H(n)$.

> The crossing number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{n_1,n_2}$ is conjectured (e.g. see Zarankiewicz [35]) to be equal to $Z(n_1, n_2) := \left\lfloor n_1/2\right\rfloor \left\lfloor (n_1 − 1)/2\right\rfloor \left\lfloor n_2/2\right\rfloor \left\lfloor (n_2 − 1)/2\right\rfloor$.
We ran the graphs $K_{n_1,n_2}$ for $5 ≤ n1 ≤ n2 ≤ 40$. Each graph was run with 100 random permutations and the minimum found solution was compared to $Z(n_1,n_2)$… As can be seen in Table 6, QuickCross was successful in obtaining the conjectured optimum in all cases and for all scheme combinations, except $K_{30,30}$ and $K_{40,40}$

This dataset was initially collected by Yuzuru Tanahashi, then stored on his homepage at UC Davis, which, unfortunately, got taken down after some time from its publication. This caused the dataset to be lost for a period of time, as none of the papers that used it provided a link to the dataset or stored it as part of their supplemental material. The experiments contained in such papers were then rendered non-reproducible because of the missing dataset. 
<!-- The effects of lost datasets are discussed more in depth in @sec-lost.  -->
Through the help of personal connections at UC Davis, we were luckily able to recover the dataset.

#### Descriptions from Literature

From “An efficient Framework for Generating Storyline Visualizations from Streaming Data”:

> The datasets we used for this study were the three movie datasets (Star Wars, The Matrix, and Inception) [25] which have been used in previous research as benchmark datasets for measuring layout legibilities. Star Wars consists of 14 entities and 200 time steps. The Matrix consists of 14 entities and 100 time steps. Inception consists of 8 entities and 490 time steps.

From “Design Considerations for Optimizing Storyline Visualizations” (origin paper):

> The basic form of the data applied in this visualization is simply a chronological list of interactions between various characters. These interactions between characters can be separated into a series of interaction sessions, each session representing the time span of a set of interacting characters.
More precisely, we define an interaction session as a unit which holds three attributes:
• initiation time,
• duration, and
• members.
Initiation time corresponds to the time when the interaction session begins. Duration corresponds to the duration of the interaction session. Members corresponds to the set of characters involved in the interaction session. Each interaction session represents a time slot in the data where its members are interacting. Note that any change in the formation of members (e.g., a character leaving or joining) indicates a separate interaction session.

> We run experiments on real-world datasets. For time-series data, we expect a gradual change and strong correlation between the different values. For weight-vectors data, we expect more erratic changes and less correlation. We use two maps with rather different geographic structures: the first (**World**) is a map of world countries, having mixed region (country) sizes in a rather unstructured manner; the second (**US**) is a map of the 48 contiguous US states, having relatively high structure in sizes of its states, with large states in the middle and along the west coast and many smaller states along the east coast.

			The SCOTCH graph collection

			===========================

The graphs that comprise this collection have been gathered from various
sites and people (Steve Hammond, the Harwell-Boeing collection, Bruce
Hendrickson, and Horst Simon). They are all stored in SCOTCH source graph
format (.src), and are accompanied with their geometry file (.xyz) whenever
available.

This directory contains:

ar_*		: Architecture graphs for classical topologies, mostly meshes.

fe_*		: Triangular and quadrangular unstructured meshes related to
		  fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, or combinatorial
		  optimization problems.

nd_*		: Valuated interprocess communication graphs issued from a
		  parallel implementation of a sparse block Cholesky
		  factorization solver, which represent partitions of the
		  unknowns induced by a nested dissection method.
		  The nd_ref0, nd_ref1, nd_ref2, nd_ref3, and nd_ref4 graphs
		  are aliases for the nd_2047.7750, nd_2453.47659,
		  nd_2815.84406, nd_3093.105713, and nd_3470.135148 graphs,
		  respectively.

#### Descriptions from Literature

From “[Multi-Level Area Balancing of Clustered Graphs](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3038154)”:

> KEGG Overview Pathway. Fig. 6 is the result of reproducing the KEGG overview pathway map using our approach. The color coding of the category here is directly retrieved from the original KEGG database [43], as similarly incorporated in Metabopolis [64] (see figures in supplementary materials, available online). We also set the same threshold for specifying unimportant vertices as in Metabopolis, so that readers can refer to the paper for comparison (Fig. 6). The advantage of this technique allows us to arrange the vertexts in a balanced fashion by pushing vertexts away from each other. This initially gives users an idea of how big each category is, and explicitly shows which reaction is classified under which category. Users can also identify sub-components effectively since those components with identical topological structures are aligned as neighbors. This also helps users to comprehend which structures are associated with certain types of pathways, such as small chains, stars, etc.

#### Descriptions from Literature

From “[EUCALYPT: efficient tree reconciliation enumerator](https://almob.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13015-014-0031-3)”:

> To test EUCALYPT, we selected 12 datasets from the literature. As we are mostly interested in host-parasite systems, the first 10 datasets concern such relations: EC Encyrtidae & Coccidae [23], GL Gopher & Lice [24], SC Seabirds & Chewing Lice [25], RP Rodents & Pinworms [26], SCF Smut Fungi & Caryophillaceus plants [27], PLML Pelican Lice ML [28] (the trees are generated through a maximum likelihood approach), PLMP Pelican Lice MP [28] (the trees are generated through a maximum parsimony approach), RH Rodents & Hantaviruses [29], PP Primates & Pinworm [30], and FD Fishs and Dactylogyrus [31].

> In addition, we used a dataset of our own which corresponds to arthropod hosts and a bacterium genus, Wolbachia, living inside the cells of their hosts [32,33]. The datasets were chosen to provide a variety in terms of size of the host and parasite trees: those from the literature are relatively small (from 7 to 100 leaves), while our own data provide an example of much bigger host and parasite trees, each having 387 leaves. Moreover, we were careful that the selected datasets cover, as much as possible, a range of situations in terms of coevolution and of the expected frequencies of each event

### Established Network Repositories {#sec-established-network-repositories}

A popular choice is to use datasets from **Established Network Repositories**. These are ample collections, often organized in dedicated websites which also offer a few stats about the contained graphs. These collections are particularly useful when trying to locate a graph with a specific structure or property. 

Because their hosts are already dedicated to the maintaining and reporting of information on these collections, we do not include here any storage of the data (which would be redundant) or report statistics on them. Rather, our analysis here is focused on highlighting their properties, origins, and ways in which they have been used.

Compiled by the [Mathematical and Computational Sciences Division](https://math.nist.gov/mcsd/) of the [Information Technology Laboratory](http://www.itl.nist.gov/) of the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](http://www.nist.gov/), the **Matrix Market** is a repository of test data for use in comparative studies of algorithms for numerical linear algebra, featuring nearly 500 sparse matrices from a variety of applications, as well as matrix generation tools and services. It has been used for experiments with <a href="#generic"><span class="pill-tag pill_color_generic">generic</span></a>graphs, <a href="#large"><span class="pill-tag pill_color_large">large</span></a>graphs, and graphs with <a href="#edge_weighted"><span class="pill-tag pill_color_edge_weighted">weighted edges</span></a> Each matrix entry is accompanied by metadata that includes the matrix name and identifier, dimensions (number of rows and columns), number of non-zero elements, symmetry type (symmetric, skew-symmetric, or general) and data type (real, complex, integer, or pattern). The website also provides visualizations of the matrices, helping users understand their structure and distribution of non-zero elements. Downloads are also provided in a variety of formats, including their own Matrix Market Exchange (MME) format, Harwell-Boeing, and MATLAB.

The REALGRAPHS set includes the 5 largest real-world graphs (mainly scale-free graphs) used in the experimental study of GILA [5]. These graphs are taken from the Stanford Large Networks Dataset Collection [3] and from the **Network Data Repository** [46], and their number of edges is between 121523 and 1541514.

From “[Drawing Big Graphs Using Spectral Sparsification](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_22)”:

> We used three data sets. The first set of graphs is taken from “defacto-benchmark” graphs, including the Hachul library, Walshaw’s Graph Partitioning Archive, the sparse matrices collection [[6](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_22#ref-CR6)] and the network repository [[24](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_22#ref-CR24)].

> **Airline Routing (Figure 5):** The nodes of this graph represent US airports, and the (unweighted) edges represent direct flights. The probability that two airports are connected by a direct flight is strongly related to their geographical distance: Most direct flights are relatively short, and only few large hub airports are connected by direct long-range flights.
The distances in the edge-repulsion LinLog layout resemble the relative geographical distances of the airports remarkably closely, given that the graph does not contain any explicit information about geographical distances.

> **Dictionary (Figure 7):** The nodes represent terms in the Online Dictionary of Library and Information Science (ODLIS), and the edges represent hyperlinks. A hyperlink between two terms exists if one term is used to describe the meaning of the other term, and thus connects semantically related terms.
The edge-repulsion LinLog layout indeed groups semantically related terms, which is better reflected in the VRML file on the supplementary web page than in Figure 7(c). Such a grouping is useful, for example, for discovering the global topic areas (like publishing, printing, information technology, etc.), for identifying entry points for the exploration of topics, or for finding semantically
related terms even if they are not explicitly linked.

#### Descriptions from Literature

From “[ForceAtlas2, a Continuous Graph Layout Algorithm for Handy Network Visualization Designed for the Gephi Software](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0098679)”:

> We benchmarked our algorithm with a dataset of 68 networks from 5 to 23,133 nodes. We tried to gather varied networks corresponding to the actual use of Gephi (a lot of social networks, and scale-free networks in general). Most of these networks are from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection ([http://snap](http://snap/). [stanford.edu/data/](http://stanford.edu/data/)) and include social networks (Facebook and Twitter ego-networks), collaboration networks (from Arxiv) and autonomous systems (peering information inferred from Oregon route-views).

#### Descriptions from Literature

From “[Crossing Minimization in Storyline Visualizations](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-50106-2_29)”:

> Since the instances “Anna Karenina” and “Les Miserables” are very big, we have split them into chapters and sequences of chapters. The resulting test-bed is made of eight chapters, seven pairs of chapters, six triples of chapters and five quadruples of chapters from “Anna Karenina”, and five chapters, four pairs of chapters and three triples of chapters from “Les Mis ́erables”, plus the entire “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”, “Inception-sf”, “Inception”, “Star Wars”, “The Matrix-sf”, and “The Matrix”.

From “[Anisotropic Radial Layout for Visualizing Centrality and Structure in Graphs](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_28)”:

> The third dataset is a graph of character associations in the famous French novel Les Miserables (Fig. 5) [18]. This graph consists of 77 nodes, each representing a character in the novel, and 254 weighted edges where the weights represent the number of chapters that feature both characters associated with an edge.
We see the that the main protagonist Valjean (marked in red) is placed prominently in all three visualizations (Fig. 5). However, other key characters in the plot such as Inspector Javert (blue) and Cosett (orange), who do not appear often with characters other than the protagonist (and thus have low betweenness centrality) are treated differently. While the radial layout relegates them to the periphery (far from Valjean) (Fig. 5b), MDS (Fig. 5a) paints a conflicting picture with regard to their centrality, e.g., Cosett’s node almost overlaps with Valjean despite its low centrality. In contrast, the proposed ARL (Fig.5c) is able to coherently convey the low centrality of the Inspector Javert and Cosett, as well as, their closeness to Valjean. The above issue of distance distortion appears to be a frequent occurrence in the radial layout due to many characters who have a low centrality value causing them to end up being packed in the outer periphery. A case of contrast is that of the character Bishop Myriel (green) who despite being associated with several characters, is only seen with Valjean once.

The **SuiteSparse Matrix Collection**, formerly known as the **University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection**, is a comprehensive repository of 2893 sparse matrices. All graphs in SuiteSparse belong to groups which will have more information about the graphs and the sub-collections they belong to. In our Descriptions from the Literature section we also highlight a few tables with the specific graphs used in a couple of papers. From “The university of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection”, Davis and Hu describe the origin of this network repository. Namely they cite the Harwell-Boeing collection as the starting point for SuiteSparse, then called the University of Florida (UF) Sparse matrix collection, back in 1991. Other groups, or collections, have then been added to SuitseSparse through the years, mainly focusing on real-world matrices and other relevant problems related to them.

#### Descriptions From Literature

From “[A Sparse Stress Model](https://dx.doi.org/10.7155/jgaa.00440)”:

> We conducted our experiments on a series of different graphs, see Tab. 1, most of them taken from the sparse matrix collection [9]. We selected these graphs as they differ in their structure and size, and are large enough to compare the results of different techniques. Two of the graphs, LeHavre and commanche, have predefined edge lengths that were derived from the node coordinates. We did not modify the graphs in any way, except for those that were disconnected, in which case we only kept the largest component.

> With the exception of graph gd, which is an author collaboration graph of the International Symposium on Graph Drawing between 1994 and 2007, the graphs used are from the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection [9]. Our selection covers a range of graph sizes, and includes mesh-like and other nonmesh graphs, and graphs from Brandes and Pich's experimental study of distance scaling [5].

::: 

One more of such collections is [Konect](http://konect.cc/). At the time of writing, though, the website for Konect has been down for a while. Both the data and the website are still accessible through [web archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231201123711/http://www.konect.cc/)---thus we do not consider this a lost collection.

#### Subsets of other collections {#sec-subsets}

Some of the datasets mentioned in the papers have, after a certain time, been integrated into other, larger collections. 
This is a phenomenon that can happen through the years, through the redistribution and through the merging of different sources: the <a href="#Walshaw" class="dataset-link">Walshaw</a> dataset, for instance, was and still is distributed and cited as its own standalone dataset, but its graphs can be now found as part of many other larger collections. 
In order to keep precise records about the data, we kept these instances separated, in order to link papers to the individual dataset they used if they explicitly mention using one of these smaller collections.
We classified these datasets as **Subsets**.

> The rest of the test graphs are taken from real-world applications. In particular, we selected graphs from the AT&T graph library [1], from C. Walshaw’s graph collection [20], and a graph that describes a social network of 2113 people that we obtained from C. Lipp.

From “[A Combined Evolutionary Search and Multilevel Optimisation Approach to Graph-Partitioning](https://doi.org/10.1023/B:JOGO.0000042115.44455.f3)”:

> The test graphs have been chosen to be a representative sample of small to medium scale real-life problems (mostly mesh-based) and include both 2D and 3D examples of nodal graphs (where the mesh nodes are partitioned) and dual graphs (where the mesh elements are partitioned). In addition there is a 3D semi-structured graph, cti, which is unstructured in the x−y plane but extended regularly along the z-axis. Finally the test suite includes three non mesh-based graphs (add32, vibrobox, bcsstk32) which arise from various scientific computing applications2. None of the graphs have either vertex or edge weights; such graphs are not widely available since most applications do not accurately instrument costs and it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from the few examples that we have access to.

> The AS-733 graph data set [48] is an autonomous systems network on the Internet with 6,474 nodes and 13,895 edges. The original graph and samples obtained by RDN, SST, MCGS are shown in Figure 5.

From “[Graphs over time: densification laws, shrinking diameters and possible explanations](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1081870.1081893)”

> The graph of routers comprising the Internet can be organized into sub-graphs called Autonomous Systems (AS). Each AS exchanges traffic flows with some neighbors (peers).
We can construct a communication network of who-talks-towhom from the BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) logs. We use the the Autonomous Systems (AS) dataset from [26]. The dataset contains 735 daily instances which span an interval of 785 days from November 8 1997 to January 2 2000.In contrast to citation networks, where nodes and edges only get added (not deleted) over time, the AS dataset also exhibits both the addition and deletion of the nodes and edges over time.

### Single Graphs {#sec-single-graphs}

A number of papers used individual, **Single Graphs** for their experiments instead of a collection. These graphs have become popular because of their properties as individual graphs - see, for example, the <a href="#Enron" class="dataset-link">Enron</a> dataset below, a huge individual graph that has a large variance in node degree distribution. Many of these graphs are also available in other repositories - their locations are noted wherever known.

Data made public by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission when investigating Enron. It has had a few changes over time documented in the link provided as its source. The data is currently hosted by William W. Cohen from CMU on a webiste, and it is also hosted on SNAP. SNAP asks to cite the paper linked in Origin paper. Very high variance in node degrees. Data can be considered threaded and directed, although <a href="#SNAP" class="dataset-link">SNAP</a> provides a version of the network that is explicitly undirected. This dataset proves useful for evaluating algorithms that work on very large graphs, due to its very large size.

From “[Reordering massive sequence views: Enabling temporal and structural analysis of dynamic networks](https://doi.org/10.1109/PacificVis.2013.6596125)”:

> We cleaned the data set by removing duplicates, spam and only to contain internal communication between Enron employees annotated with employee function leaving us with 151 nodes (employees) and 21374 edges (emails). Visualization using a node-link diagram enables the identification of stronger connections (see Figure 9(a)). However, temporal patterns and the evolution of the network cannot be analysed. From the standard MSV (Figure 9(b)) it becomes somewhat clear that transaction density increases over time and we can distinguish between different phases. We cannot, however, see features and identify communities due to visual clutter

150 enron executives (users), 500k messages - many more employees

some have attachments

case nodes are users: could be a very connected dataset (perhaps too few nodes) - very high variance in node degree

case nodes are messages: could be a sparsely connected graph

there’s dates → can be layered

This dataset was collected and prepared by the

[CALO Project](http://www.ai.sri.com/project/CALO)

(A Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes). It contains data from about 150 users, mostly senior management of Enron, organized into folders. The corpus contains a total of about 0.5M messages. This data was originally

[made public, and posted to the web](http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/10/14/enron/index_np.html)

, by the

[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission](http://www.ferc.gov/)

during its investigation.

The email dataset was later purchased by [Leslie Kaelbling](http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/lpk/lpk.html) at MIT, and turned out to have a number of integrity problems. A number of folks at SRI, notably [Melinda Gervasio](http://www.ai.sri.com/people/gervasio), worked hard to correct these problems, and it is thanks to them (not me) that the dataset is available. The dataset here does not include attachments, and some messages have been deleted "as part of a redaction effort due to requests from affected employees". Invalid email addresses were converted to something of the form user@enron.com whenever possible (i.e., recipient is specified in some parse-able format like "Doe, John" or "Mary K. Smith") and to no_address@enron.com when no recipient was specified.

**Fig. 1.** *A graph laid out using our treemap based approach*. This graph portrays the links between websites that came from a search on the word “California” [7]. Nodes are clustered into a hierarchy, and laid out by applying a treemap to this hierarchy. Levels of the hierarchy below a threshold are clustered together into larger nodes. It can very easily be seen that there are three primary groups of websites that link to each other, and a plethora of others that are not as tightly linked.

> We have tested our method on the “World Greenhouse Gas Emissions” data from the World Resources Institute [8]. After transforming the “long” edges of the graph into “short” edges and adding the corresponding dummy nodes, as described in Section 3, this example has 4 layers, 55 nodes and 100 edges. The node ordering in the layout of the Sankey diagram shown in Figure 1 has been computed using Sugiyama’s heuristic method [13].

> **The Tree of Life:** captures the evolutionary progression of life on Earth [[37](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-22203-0_23#ref-CR37)]. The underlying data is a tree structure with a natural time component. As a new species evolves, a new node in the tree is added. The edges give the parent-child relation of the nodes, where the parent is the original species, and the child is the new species. We use a subset of this graph with 500 nodes. The maximum node degree of this tree is 5, and the radius is 24

> The difference between conventional energy models, node-repulsion LinLog, and edge-repulsion LinLog can be illustrated with a model of the trade between ten North American and European countries. The nodes of the graph correspond to the countries, and the edge weights specify the trade volume between each pair of countries. Because of geographical closeness and free trade agreements, countries on the same continent trade more intensively than countries on different continents. Figure 1 shows the minimum energy layouts of the trade graph for the three force and energy models. The layout of the widely used Fruchterman-Reingold model [20] does not show any clear groups at all. The layout of the node-repulsion LinLog energy model groups the countries (nodes) primarily according to their total trade volume (degree). Only the layout of the edge-repulsion LinLog energy model shows the expected grouping according to continents.

Various types of protein interaction graphs are recorded in other network collections. We highlight two of them from the surveyed papers. First, we have the temporal Protein Interaction Publications, showing the history of how protein interactions were described in the literature. Second, the Protein Homology graph was provided by the Large Graph Layout project, their links are now broken and the dataset lost.

#### Description from the Literature

From [TimeArcs: Visualizing Fluctuations in Dynamic Networks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.12882):

> The data contains the publication information (such as publication year, author, and textual evidence) of interactions between pairs of proteins, as well as their specific interaction type.

> When there are multiple arcs connecting two proteins, it falls into one of the two circumstances. If they have the same color, these arcs indicate that there are supporting evidences in different publications which *confirm* the interaction between two elements. On the other hand, if they have the different colors, the more recent appearance provides either more detailed knowledge about the interaction or shows a *conflict* between different articles regarding the way in which these proteins interact.

### Aggregate Collections {#sec-aggregate-collections}

Many papers use graphs from specific domains that contain particular characteristics, such as geographical coordinates often found in airline data. Instead of collecting each of these individual, contextual datasets, we aggregated them into subcategories called **Aggregate collections**. These collections group together datasets from the same real-life context, which may have multiple sources. Real-life contexts are distinguishable by specific properties or requirements found in graphs from those sources; for instance, collaboration networks can be represented as hypergraphs, while air traffic routes have nodes (airports) with fixed spatial coordinates and numerous edges connecting the nodes, making them suitable for edge bundling algorithms. Individual information about each aggregate collection can be found in the papers that contain them.

Through a query consisting of keywords and Boolean operators, one can retrieve a set of publications on a desired topic. We use the results returned by DBLP to construct networks where nodes are authors and edges indicate co-authorships, weighted by the number of papers shared by their end-nodes. Nodes are labeled with authors’ names and edges with the titles of the corresponding publications. 
We performed the query “network AND visualization” and limited to 500 the number of search results (i.e., publications) to be returned. The resulting network consists of 1766 nodes, 3780 edges, and 382 connected components. The largest of these components contains 118 nodes and 322 edges.

#### Descriptions from Literature

From “[Skeleton-Based Edge Bundling for Graph Visualization](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.233)”:

> Figure 7 illustrates the SBEB and compares it with several existing bundling methods. Note that in all images here generated with our method, we used simple additive edge blending only, as our focus here is the layout, not the rendering. Images (a,b) show an air traffic graph (nodes are city locations, edges are interconnecting flights)… Images (e-h) show the US migrations graph bundled with the WR, GBEB, FDEB, and our method (SBEB) respectively. Overall, SBEB produces stronger bundling, due to the many iterations I = 10 being used), and emphasizes the structure of connections between groups of close cities (due to the skeleton layout cues). If less bundling is desired, fewer iterations can be used (Fig. 4). Adjusting the postprocessing smoothing and relaxation parameters, SBEB can create bundling styles similar to either GBEB (higher bundle curvatures, more emphasis on the graph structure) or FDEB (smoother bundles). Finally, images (i,j) show the US airlines graph bundled with the FDEB and SBEB respectively. SBEB generates stronger bundling (more overdraw) but arguably less clutter. Note also that SBEB generates treelike bundle structures which is useful when the exploration task at hand has an inherent (local) hierarchical nature, e.g. see how traffic connections merge into and/or split from main traffic routes.

**Fig. 1.** Edge bundling of the migrations dataset. (a) Straight line drawing. (b) Force-directed edge bundling aggregates edges well, but overaggregates at the centre of the drawing making it difficult to see patterns in the east-west flow (red bundle). (c) Cubu has a similar drawback at the centre of the map to a lesser degree. (d) Winding roads divides this structure into several smaller flows, but they may not be necessarily related to graph structure. (e) Edge-path bundling is able to distinguish between several flows that reflect paths in the underlying graph. (f) When edge direction is considered, the algorithm is able to further subdivide these flows based on direction.

**Fig. 8.** Airlines (undirected). (a) Input drawing. (b) Force-directed bundling is able to cluster edges into the major flows, but some overaggregation prevents details from being visualised. (c) Cubu provides a good bundling, but also has overaggregation. (c) Confluent drawings can be imposed on the layout, but as the approach cannot layout the graph bicliques can be distantly located, resulting in suboptimal performance. (e) Winding roads divides the flows into many streams, but these streams can be unfaithful to graph structure. (f) Edge-path bundling aggregates edges using weighted paths. The four prominent bundle intersections on the east coast correspond to major airports: Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis, and Dallas.

**Fig. 10.** Results of four algorithms on the air traffic network. (a) Force-directed bundling is able to recover the major trajectories but does not strongly bundle the network. (b) Cubu strongly bundles the main flows of airtraffic, but can suffer from overaggregation. (c) Winding roads divides the traffic into many smaller bundles, but this may not be reflective of underlying graph structure. (d) With edge-path bundling, each bundle necessarily reflects a path in the network. There are separate flows across the atlantic and asia that correspond to paths through the network.

Various software call dependency graphs have been used in the literature. We provide the benchmarks used in [A Random Sampling O(n) Force-calculation Algorithm for Graph Layouts](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cgf.13724), as these posed the most comprehensive and available collection. [Parallel Edge Splatting for Scalable Dynamic Graph Visualization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065001) used a software call graph from a device called a “Phillips Medical System Eindhoven medical scanner”, which is lost. Python and Eclipse subversion control logs are also currently lost.

From “[Hierarchical Edge Bundles: Visualization of Adjacency Relations in Hierarchical Data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4015425)”:

> The software is part of a medical scanner and was provided by Philips Medical Systems Eindhoven.

**Fig. 13.** A software system and its associated call graph (caller = green, callee = red). (a) and (b) show the system with bundling strength β = 0.85 using a balloon layout (node labels disabled) and a radial layout, respectively. Bundling reduces visual clutter, making it easier to perceive the actual connections than when compared to the non-bundled versions (figures 2a and 11a). Bundled visualizations also show relations between sparsely connected systems more clearly (encircled regions); these are almost completely obscured in the non-bundled versions. The encircled regions highlight identical parts of the system for (a), (b), and figure 15.

#### Zachary Karate Club Dataset

#### Descriptions from Literature

*[The Turing Test for Graph Drawing Algorithms](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-68766-3_36)*  describes the dataset simply as “social network” in their Table 1.

From [Anisotropic Radial Layout for Visualizing Centrality and Structure in Graphs](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_28):

> The Zachary’s karate club graph is a well known data set that is a social network of friendships in a karate club at a US university, as recorded during a study [[32](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_28#ref-CR32)]. This graph contains 34 nodes, each representing an individual, and 78 unweighted edges that represent a friendship between the associated individuals (Fig. [1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_28#Fig1)). During the period of observation, a conflict between two key members, identified as the “administrator” and “instructor”, leads to a split in the club, giving it an interesting two cluster structure. In Fig. [1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_28#Fig1), nodes representing members who are part of the instructor’s and administrator’s groups are drawn in green and blue, respectively.

#### Facebook100

#### Description from Literature

From [Untangling the Hairballs of Multi-Centered, Small-World Online Social Media Networks](https://jgaa.info/getPaper?id=370):

> As real world samples, we use the Facebook100 dataset [40], which contains social relations of 100 higher educational institutes in the US. The network size varies from 762 to 41K vertices and from 16K to 1.6M edges. Thedataset is directly from Facebook, not sampled, and thus very complete in terms of capturing the social relations according to a widely used service at that time. Additional attributes obtained from the Facebook profiles are gender, expected year of graduation, dormitory, etc. Due to incomplete profiles, a number of attribute values are missing.
> 

#### Example Figures

From [Untangling the Hairballs of Multi-Centered, Small-World Online Social Media Networks](https://jgaa.info/getPaper?id=370)

**Fig. 1.** Facebook friendships at California Institute of Technology (Caltech36). Vertex color corresponds to dormitory (gray for missing values), but has not been utilized by the layout algorithm. The layout in (a) is based on the entire graph, whereas (b)-(f) use edge embeddedness, which spreads the graph while keeping cohesive groups together. Embeddedness mapped to edge color; backbone edges dark gray.

#### Facebook Ego Networks (Facebook 1864)

#### Description from Literature

From ****[Preserving Minority Structures in Graph Sampling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222065)

> The Facebook1684 graph data set is an online social network with 775 nodes and 14,006 edges. The original graph and six samples are shown in Figure 4. This data set is an unbalanced graph in which two large communities include 705 nodes and two small communities/cliques contain only 70 nodes.
> 

The [supplemental](https://github.com/saibalmars/RicciFlow-SampleGraphs/tree/61f9c2c48d0de368369e232da959c4f996122e3a) material for *****[Network Alignment by Discrete Ollivier-Ricci Flow](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04414-5_32)* also provides user 1864 of the Facebook ego networks in their repository. 

From [A Random Sampling O(n) Force-calculation Algorithm for Graph Layouts](https://osf.io/dcz5h):

> The ego graphs are Facebook ego graphs [**[ML12](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.13724#cgf13724-bib-0060)**] with the ego vertex re-added to the graph.

**Fig. 4.** Interface for subjective assessment experiment with the Facebook1684 data set (775 nodes and 14,006 edges). The leftmost graph is the original graph. The six randomly arranged samples are generated by SST (a), FF (b), MCGS (c), RW (d), TIES (e), and RDN (f) with a sampling rate of 30%.

#### Van De Bunt Fraternity

#### Description from the Literature

From [Preserving Minority Structures in Graph Sampling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222065)

> *Van De Bunt (Discrete):* shows the relationships between 32 freshmen at seven different time points. A discrete dynamic graph is built using the method of Brandes *et al.*  [[9](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_31#ref-CR9)], with an undirected edge inserted into a timeslice if the participants reciprocally report “best friendship” or “friendship” at that time.

#### **Syphilis Social Network**

#### Description from the Literature

From [SetCoLa: High-Level Constraints for Graph Layout](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.13440):

> Social networks can be a powerful way to understand inter-personal relationships and are useful for tracking the spread of diseases that result from personal contact [**[RST*98](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.13440#cgf13440-bib-0045)**, **[FHH*01](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.13440#cgf13440-bib-0022)**, **[MRV*03](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.13440#cgf13440-bib-0043)**, **[FHD*11](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.13440#cgf13440-bib-0021)**]. The ability to track and identify at risk individuals can lead to treatment and help manage the spread of the disease. In addition to the links between individuals, structuring the layout by node properties such as the social or ethnographically-identified group may reveal additional details about how the disease is spread.

**Fig. 4.** The layout for the syphilis social network from (a) Rothenberg et al. [[RST*98](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.13440#cgf13440-bib-0045)]. (b) We recreated and improved the layout in SetCoLa by introducing additional padding, alignment, and circle constraints to further highlight the relative number of interactions among the different groups. For both figures, the nodes are split into three groups, from left to right: young affluent white men, younger white women, and young African-American men. Individuals not associated with any of these “core” groups are positioned above the others. In both figures, individuals diagnosed with syphilis during the outbreak are labeled with an “S” on the node label.

Contact Network

This dataset contains the daily dynamic contact networks collected during the [Infectious SocioPatterns](http://www.sociopatterns.org/deployments/infectious-sociopatterns/) event that took place at the [Science Gallery](http://www.sciencegallery.com/) in Dublin, Ireland, during the artscience exhibition [INFECTIOUS: STAY AWAY](http://www.sciencegallery.com/infectious). Each file in the downloadable package contains a tab-separated list representing the active contacts during 20-second intervals of one day of data collection.  Each line has the form “t i j“, where i and j are the anonymous IDs of the persons in contact, and the interval during which this contact was active is [ t – 20s, t ]. If multiple contacts are active in a given interval, you will see multiple lines starting with the same value of t. Time is measured in seconds and expressed in UNIX ctime.

“This evaluation uses 109 common graphs from network science and graph algorithm research (note: many graphs from older research are no longer available online).”

# C. Lipp?

> The rest of the test graphs are taken from real-world applications. In particular, we selected graphs from the AT&T graph library [1], from C. Walshaw’s graph collection [20], and a graph that describes a social network of 2113 people that we obtained from C. Lipp.

#### Description from Literature

> Apart from the example of Sydney presented in Section 6, we have evaluated our method for two additional real-world networks: Vienna, which is a rather small network, and London, the oldest and still one of the most complex metro systems in the world. These networks have not been used as examples for previous metro map layout methods, so we can compare only against the official maps of Vienna and London. The size of the metro graphs (including Sydney) is given in Table 3 and ranges from 84 vertices and 8 faces (Vienna) to 308 vertices and 55 faces (London). The table further shows how the removal of degree-2 vertices described in Section 5.1 effectively reduces the number of vertices and edges.

### Lost and unavailable datasets {#sec-lost}

Unfortunately, some of the datasets that were used in the papers in our corpus are lost, or not available anymore. A dataset that is not anymore accessible renders all the papers using it unfortunately not reproducible. Most of the instances we found became lost because of lack of maintenance of the original storage locations: websites, servers, or repositories. This is, unfortunately, a significant issue in science, which is now hopefully gaining more and more attention.

"Loss" of a dataset does not exclusively mean that the entire, original dataset became lost, but also that a paper using a dataset with particular edits---such as interpreting a <a href="#Debates" class="dataset-link">debate</a> as a graph between the participants---has not documented well enough their process and did not link to the edited dataset. This makes it impossible to reproduce the results of the paper, and is further discussed in @sec-custom-made-datasets.

While we did go through the effort, for each one of them, to recover them and store them on OSF, we could not find anywhere the following list of datasets:

From “[An Experimental Study on the Ply Number of Straight-Line Drawings](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-53925-6_11)”:

> **Graph Datasets.** To understand whether the experimental results are influenced by the structure of the graph we considered several graph families. All graphs are of small or medium size, expressed as the number of their vertices. In some cases, the size and the number of instances used for each graph family depends on the type of question we want to answer (see Sect. 5 for details). We used the following datasets:
**Trees.** Generated with uniform probability distribution using Pru ̈fer sequences [28].
**Planar.** Connected simple planar graphs, generated with the OGDF library [6].
**General.** Connected simple graphs, generated with uniform probability distribution.
**Scale-free.** Scale-free graphs, generated according to the Barabasi-Albert model [2].
**Caterpillars.** Each caterpillar of n vertices is generated by first creating a path (spine of the caterpillar) of length $k\in [ \frac{n}{4} , \frac{n}{2} ]$ (randomly chosen), and attaching each remaining vertex to a randomly selected vertex of the spine.
**Paths, Cycles.** For each desired number of vertices n, there is only one (unlabeled) path and one (unlabeled) cycle of n vertices.
**k-ary Trees.** Rooted trees where each node has either 0 or k children. Each tree is generated by starting with a single vertex and then creating k children of a randomly selected leaf, until the desired number n of vertices is achieved. When n cannot be obtained, we use a value close to it.

From “[An Interactive Tool to Explore and Improve the Ply Number of Drawings](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_4)”:

> **FM3data** contains 50 caterpillars with 250 to 450 vertices… **FM3data** also contains planar graphs ranging from 250 to 400 vertices and a density ranging from 1.5 to 2… The remaining subset of **FM3data** consists of general graphs with 250 to 450 vertices and the densities 1.5 and 2.5.

#### Descriptions from Literature

From ‘’[Yarn: Generating Storyline Visualizations Using HTN Planning](https://doi.org/10.20380/GI2018.05)”:

> For our first example we use a narrative adapted from the video game Witcher 2 to show the capabilities of Yarn. In our example narrative, the hero, Geralt of Rivia needs to rescue his friend, Triss Merigold, who has mysteriously disappeared. On his journey to find her he must first determine where she was seen last, talk to multiple friends, and resolve a conflict between a troll couple before he can meet her.
There are two choice points in this narrative: first, Margot can either choose to help Geralt or refuse to provide help; second, the troll couple can either accept or reject Geralt’s solution to their conflict. Each of these choices affects the outcome of the narrative creating three possible timelines.
The first timeline contains events favorable to Geralt. In this timeline, Margot agrees to help Geralt and the troll couple accept Geralt’s solution leading him to find Triss. Fig. 5 shows a visualization of this outcome as the reality timeline for our narrative. We can see that Geralt was able to successfully track Triss’s last known location, gather information from friends, resolve a conflict between the trolls, and meet Triss. Note that in this visualization we are showing the default, reality timeline and all links are drawn with 100% opacity. We can also observe all single-entity events in the narrative in this visualization.
In the second timeline, the trolls reject Geralt’s solution to their conflict. Fig. 6 shows a visualization of this unfavorable outcome as diegetic timeline overlaid on top of the reality timeline. While most of the events are same in both timelines, the diegetic timeline ends at the event “Speak to She-Troll.” The reduced opacity of the reality timeline allows the user to compare common sections of the two timelines, even when one of them is smaller than the other.
In the third timeline, Margot refuses to help Geralt preventing him from progressing further on his quest. This is the shortest timeline in our narrative.

From ‘’[Yarn: Generating Storyline Visualizations Using HTN Planning](https://doi.org/10.20380/GI2018.05)”:

> For our second example we use a fictional narrative scenario based on the popular sitcom Friends.
In this narrative, Ross’s plan is to take Rachel on a date. To do so, he must acquire more information about her, find some way of talking to her, ensure she is positively disposed towards him, and eventually ask her out. He can acquire more information about her in a number of ways including calling her mother, or asking Phoebe about her by either call or text. To ensure she is in a positive mood, he can either give her a gift or say nice things to her, and finally he can either ask her out himself or ask for Phoebe’s help. To illustrate causality of events in the narrative timeline, we have set up the operator functions for Rachel such that she is more inclined to say yes to Ross if he talks to her mother rather than requesting Phoebe’s help. Additionally, Rachel’s probability of accepting Ross’s proposal is also dependent on how impressed she is by him when he asks her.
There are four choice points in this narrative: three for Ross, and one for Rachel. The choices made by Ross create 12 alternate timelines, each illustrating a different way in which he can ask Rachel out. Towards the end of each timeline Rachel can decide to either reply yes to Ross, or reply no, creating a total of 24 timelines.
Fig. 7 shows a visualization where Rachel agrees to go out with Ross in both timelines. While the timelines result in the same outcome, and visually look the same, we can inspect the labels on top of the events in Ross’s timeline to identify the differences. Lighter labels correspond to the reality timeline, while darker labels correspond to the diegetic timeline. In the reality timeline, Ross decided to give a gift to Rachel after talking to her mom, while in the diegetic timeline he decided to act friendly with her.
Fig. 8 shows another visualization for the same narrative. In this example we can see the effect of causal conditions set in the operator functions for Rachel. In the reality timeline, Rachel decided not to go out with Ross because he asked Phoebe for help by messaging her. On the other hand, she agreed to go out with him in the diegetic timeline because in this case Ross decided to talk to her mother.

#### Description from Literature

From “[DICON: Interactive Visual Analysis of Multidimensional Clusters](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.188)”:

> We also applied DICON within the healthcare domain to visualize a dataset containing more than 10,000 patient records. The data includes claims, labs, pharmacy, and patient profile information. To augment this data, we applied a patient similarity algorithm to compute patient similarity scores across multiple dimensions (e.g., diagnoses, lab results, etc.). We also indexed the patient records to make the data searchable.

> We considered a real network of taxpayers and their economic transactions. The network is provided by the IRV (Italian Revenue Agency) and refers to a portion of data for the fiscal year 2014, consisting of 174 subjects with high fiscal risk and 200 economic transactions between them [[11](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-35802-0_22#ref-CR11)].

From “[A visual analytics system to support tax evasion discovery](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923618300563?via%3Dihub#s0015)”:

> The data sources queried by the IRV officers are modeled in TaxNet as a unified network *G*. Each node *v* of *G* is a single taxpayer, which can be either an individual or a legal person, like a private company or a public institution. Many attributes are associated with *v*, including the type of economic activity, the geographic location and territorial scope, the declared income, the amount of VAT credits/debts and of VAT refunded/paid, and the amount of economic exchange within the European Union. The edges of *G* are directed edges. An edge (*u*,*v*) can model different types of relationships between *u* and *v*.

The authors did not respond to requests to make this dataset available.

Note: we found the Debates dataset used for the paper mentioned below in the internal storage of the university of Konstanz, now available on OSF [at this link](https://osf.io/rp483/metadata/?format=datacite-json). However, additional non-trivial processing was made to the data to generate the entity relationship data used in the paper. Because of this, we still consider the dataset as lost.

#### Description from Literature

From “[NEREx: Named-Entity Relationship Exploration in Multi-Party Conversations](https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13181)”:

> In order to explore the relations between entities, we use a distance-restricted model for creating entity-pairs. As described in Section 2, prior work considers relations between entities either as semantic relations based on linguistic knowledge or regards two entities as related due to their presence in the same document. The often ungrammatical structure of utterances in verbatim text transcripts (including non-standard lexical items, syntactic patterns, interruptions, repetitions, and crosstalk) requires a simple extralinguistic model. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a model that bounds the scope in which we consider two entities to be related, using a distance threshold (*maxDist*). Our method creates a pair of entities if the entities appear in the same sentences within *maxDist* words of one another.

> However, not only are frequent entity-pairs important, but also pairs that are semantically similar (e.g., *cut $5 trillion*, *cut $4 trillion*). These often present opposing speaker opinions about a given topic. To maximize the chance that entity-pairs represent true semantic relations, we set the default value of *maxDist* to a low value (5 words). To vary the granularity of the analysis, the parameter can be changed interactively depending on the analysis task and data. Nevertheless, some infrequent longer-distance entity-pairs are discovered which do not represent salient relations. To reduce their impact, we calculate the average observed distance (in words) for each entity pair. We use both frequency and average distance in the visualization to reflect the strength of the entity-pair.

> We use 13 datasets (see supplementary material), which represent real-world processes. For every dataset, we ran 500 tests on both methods. Each test involved a pair of randomly generated graphs  $G_1, G_2 \subseteq \bar{G}$  , which were obtained by randomly removing a subset of the edges $\bar{E}$ and then removing all nodes $n \in \bar{V}$ that became disconnected. Consequently, $G_1$ and $G_2$ are random sub-graphs of $\bar{G}$ .

It is non-planar because multiple advisors can advise the same person or a person can have multiple advisors! Infact, there is a K3,3 in it

In July 2016, Cosmin Ionita and Pat Quillen of 
MathWorks used MATLAB to analyze the Math Genealogy Project graph. At 
the time, the genealogy graph contained 200,037 vertices. There were 
7639 (3.8%) isolated vertices and 1962 components of size two 
(advisor-advisee pairs where we have no information about the advisor). 
The largest component of the genealogy graph contained 180,094 vertices,
 accounting for 90% of all vertices in the graph. The main component has
 7323 root vertices (individuals with no advisor) and 137,155 leaves 
(mathematicians with no students), accounting for 76.2% of the vertices 
in this component. The next largest component sizes were 81, 50, 47, 34,
 34, 33, 31, 31, and 30.
For historical comparisonn, we also have data from June 2010, when 
Professor David Joyner of the United States Naval Academy asked for data
 from our database to analyze it as a graph. At the time, the genealogy 
graph had 142,688 vertices. Of these, 7,190 were isolated vertices (5% 
of the total). The largest component had 121,424 vertices (85% of the 
total number). The next largest component had 128 vertices. The next 
largest component sizes were 79, 61, 45, and 42. The most frequent size 
of a nontrivial component was 2; there were 1937 components of size 2. 
The component with 121,424 vertices had 4,639 root verticies, i.e., 
mathematicians for whom the advisor is currently unknown.

The Mathematics Genealogy Project graph is nonplanar. Thanks to 
Professor Ezra Brown of Virginia Tech for assisting in finding the 
subdivision of *K*3,3 depicted below. The green vertices
 form one color class and the yellow ones form the other. Interestingly,
 Gauß is the only vertex that needs to be connected by paths with more 
than one edge.

### Custom-made Datasets {#sec-custom-made-datasets}
In the data we collected, we also found several instances of custom-made datasets. We consider custom-made datasets either edits to pre-existing datasets, where the authors found it necessary to either split or modify the dataset in a particular way, or datasets completely made up from scratch using random generators or custom-made code. This can happen in cases where the authors of a paper needed a dataset containing particular characteristics which was not easy to find in the wild, so a new dataset was crafted.

For instance, consider the case where the authors of a paper develop an algorithm that works on hypergraphs. They want to test that the algorithm works, and test its performance on hypergraphs of various sizes, but datasets containing hypergraphs are difficult to find. For this reason, the authors craft one dataset synthetically, or take a pre-existing dataset and edit it so that it now contains hyperedges. 

We split custom-made datasets in three categories, with their occurrences in the corpus of papers illustrated below:


```{ojs}
//| echo: false
{ 
  let d = []
  
  let allbenchmarkdatasets = [...new Set(literature.map(l => l["Dataset tag clean"].split(",").map(d => d.trim())).flat())].filter(a => a != "")

  for (let dataset of allbenchmarkdatasets){
    if (!dataset.includes("Custom")) continue;
    let literature_entries_with_this_dataset = literature.filter(l => l["Dataset tag clean"].includes(dataset))

    d.push({"dataset": dataset, "count": literature_entries_with_this_dataset.length})
  }
  
  return Plot.plot({
    color: {
      // legend: true,
      type: "categorical",
      // domain: d3.range(10).map((d, i) => `Category ${i + 1}`),
      scheme: "Tableau10" // use the "accent" scheme
    },
    y: {
      // tickFormat: "s"
    },
    marks: [
      Plot.barX(d, {x: "count", y: "dataset", fill: "dataset",inset: 2, sort: {y: "x", reverse: true}}),
      Plot.axisY({label: null, lineWidth: 12, marginLeft: 150}),
    ]
  })
}
```


**Replicable** datasets indicate cases where the authors have given enough information so that the experiment can be replicated exactly as it was run by the authors of a paper, or closely enough that the results obtained reflect the published ones very closely. This includes cases where either the authors published the entire dataset they used, they published the code they used to generate the dataset, or include an exact description of the steps they took to generate it.

**Reproducible** datasets are cases where the authors described the steps they took to generate and/or edit their datasets, but not in-depth enough so that the exact same graphs can be reproduced, and did not redistribute it. Results can still be reproduces somewhat closely if the authors took care to report enough information about their graphs.

For **non-replicable** datasets, we indicate cases where the authors did not distribute their datasets and did not include enough information in the paper so that their results could be replicated. 

This information is closely tied to the distribution of supplemental material in papers, that is shown in the chart below:

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
{ 
  let d = []
  
  let allbenchmarkdatasets = [...new Set(literature.map(l => l["Supplemental material (Multi-select)"].split(",").map(d => d.trim())).flat())].filter(a => a != "")

  for (let dataset of allbenchmarkdatasets){
    let literature_entries_with_this_dataset = literature.filter(l => l["Supplemental material (Multi-select)"].includes(dataset))

    d.push({"dataset": dataset, "count": literature_entries_with_this_dataset.length})
  }
  
  return Plot.plot({
    color: {
      // legend: true,
      type: "categorical",
      // domain: d3.range(10).map((d, i) => `Category ${i + 1}`),
      scheme: "Tableau10" // use the "accent" scheme
    },
    y: {
      // tickFormat: "s"
    },
    marks: [
      Plot.barX(d, {x: "count", y: "dataset", fill: "dataset",inset: 2, sort: {y: "x", reverse: true}}),
      Plot.axisY({label: null, lineWidth: 12, marginLeft: 150}),
    ]
  })
}
```



This discussion is part of a larger discourse on research replicability, that is gaining traction in the scientific community. The ACM, for instance, has a policy on artifact review and badging, where authors are encouraged to submit their artifacts for review, and if they pass, they receive a badge that indicates the artifact is available for review. This is a step towards making research more replicable and reproducible, and we hope that our work will contribute to this effort. 

See, e.g., ACM's definitions at [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current).
