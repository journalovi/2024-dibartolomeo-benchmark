The datasets were chosen to provide a variety in terms of size of the host and parasite trees: those from the literature are relatively small (from 7 to 100 leaves), while our own data provide an example of much bigger host and parasite trees, each having 387 leaves. Moreover, we were careful that the selected datasets cover, as much as possible, a range of situations in terms of coevolution and of the expected frequencies of each event\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “Visualizing Co-phylogenetic Reconciliations”:\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-08-15 at 10.50.19 AM.png\n\n\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-08-15 at 10.50.09 AM.png\n\n\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-08-15 at 10.49.57 AM.png\n\n\n=== STOP RENDERING ===\nfrom Visualizing Co-phylogenetic Reconciliations Eucalypt tool (Donati, B., Baudet, C., Sinaimeri, B., Crescenzi, P., Sagot, M.F.: EUCALYPT: efficient tree reconciliation enumerator.

The files presented here are the frames 0, 10, and 20 of\n    the sequences, respectively.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKronecker:  Kronecker Generator Graphs\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    The original Kronecker files contain self-loops and multiple edges.\n    These properties are also present in real-world data sets. However,\n    some tools cannot handle these \"artifacts\" at the moment. That is why\n    we present \"cleansed\" versions of the data sets as well.  For the\n    Challenge you should expect to be confronted with the original data\n    with self-loops and multiple edges. However, the final decision on\n    this issue will be made based on participant feedback.\n\n    All files have been generated with the R-MAT parameters A=0.57, B=0.19,\n    C=0.19, and D=1-(A+B+C)=0.05 and edgefactor=48, i.e., the number of\n    edges equals 48*n, where n is the number of vertices. Details about the\n    generator and the parameter meanings can be found on the Graph500\n    website.  ( http://www.graph500.org/Specifications.html )\n\n    There are 12 graphs in the DIMACS10 test set at\n    http://www.cc.gatech.edu/dimacs10/index.shtml .  Them come in 6 pairs.\n    One graph in each pair is a multigraph, with self-edges.  The other\n    graph is the nonzero pattern of the first (binary), with self-edges\n    removed.  MATLAB cannot directly represent multigraph, so in the UF\n    Collection the unweighted multigraph G is represented as a matrix A\n    where A(i,j) is an integer equal to the number edges (i,j) in G.\n\n    The binary graphs include the word 'simple' in their\n    name In the UF Collection, only the multigraph is included,\n    since the simple graph can be constructed from the multigraph.\n    If A is the multigraph, the simple graph S can be computed as:\n\n       S = spones (tril (A,-1)) + spones (triu (A,1)) ;\n\n    DIMACS10 graph:                        UF matrix:\n    ---------------                        -------------\n    kronecker/kron_g500-logn16             DIMACS10/kron_g500-logn16\n    kronecker/kron_g500-simple-logn16\n\n    kronecker/kron_g500-logn17             DIMACS10/kron_g500-logn17\n    kronecker/kron_g500-simple-logn17\n\n    kronecker/kron_g500-logn18             DIMACS10/kron_g500-logn18\n    kronecker/kron_g500-simple-logn18\n\n    kronecker/kron_g500-logn19             DIMACS10/kron_g500-logn19\n    kronecker/kron_g500-simple-logn19\n\n    kronecker/kron_g500-logn20             DIMACS10/kron_g500-logn20\n    kronecker/kron_g500-simple-logn20\n\n    kronecker/kron_g500-logn21             DIMACS10/kron_g500-logn21\n    kronecker/kron_g500-simple-logn21\n\n    References: \"Introducing the Graph 500,\" Richard C.

Each vertex is a\n    random point in the unit square and edges connect vertices whose\n    Euclidean distance is below 0.55 (ln n)/n. This threshold was choosen\n    in order to ensure that the graph is almost connected.\n\n    Note:  the UF Collection is a collection of matrices primarily from\n    real applications.  The only random matrices I add to the collection\n    are those used in established benchmarks (such as DIMACS10).\n\n    Engineering a scalable high quality graph partitioner,\n    M. Holtgrewe, P.

The Open\n    Street Map road networks have been taken from\n    http://download.geofabrik.de and have been converted for DIMACS10\n    by Moritz Kobitzsch (kobitzsch at kit.edu) as follows:\n\n    First, we took the corresponding graph and extracted all routeable\n    streets. Routable streets are objects in this file that are tagged\n    using one of the following tags: motorway, motorway_link, trunk\n    trunk_link, primary, primary_link, secondary, secondary_link,\n    tertiary, tertiary_link, residential, unclassified, road,\n    living_street, and service.  Next, we now compute the largest\n    strongly connected component of this extracted open street map graph.\n    Self-edges and parallel edges are removed afterwards.\n    The DIMACS 10 graph is now the undirected and unweighted version\n    of the constructed graph, i.e.  if there is an edge (u,v) but the\n    reverse edge (v,u) is missing, we insert the reverse edge into the\n    graph.  The XY coordinates of each node in the graph are preserved.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWalshaw:  Chris Walshaw's graph partitioning archive\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Chris Walshaw's graph partitioning archive contains 34 graphs that\n    have been very popular as benchmarks for graph partitioning algorithms\n    ( http://staffweb.cms.gre.ac.uk/~wc06/partition/ ).\n\n    17 of them are already in the UF Collection.

The nodes weights are the POP100 variable of\n    Census2010-PL94, and the area of eache district.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nstar-mixtures : artificially generated from sets of real graphs\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Each graph in this benchmark represents a star-like structure of different\n    graphs S0 , . . . , St. Graphs S1 , . . . , St are weakly connected to the\n    center S0 by random edges. The total number of edges between each Si and S0\n    was less than 3% out of the total number of edges in Si . The graphs are\n    mixtures of the following structures: social networks, finite-element\n    graphs, VLSI chips, peer-to-peer networks, and matrices from optimization\n    solvers.\n\n    More info can be found in the paper I.

In our example narrative, the hero, Geralt of Rivia needs to rescue his friend, Triss Merigold, who has mysteriously disappeared. On his journey to find her he must first determine where she was seen last, talk to multiple friends, and resolve a conflict between a troll couple before he can meet her. There are two choice points in this narrative: first, Margot can either choose to help Geralt or refuse to provide help; second, the troll couple can either accept or reject Geralt’s solution to their conflict. Each of these choices affects the outcome of the narrative creating three possible timelines. The first timeline contains events favorable to Geralt. In this timeline, Margot agrees to help Geralt and the troll couple accept Geralt’s solution leading him to find Triss. Fig. 5 shows a visualization of this outcome as the reality timeline for our narrative. We can see that Geralt was able to successfully track Triss’s last known location, gather information from friends, resolve a conflict between the trolls, and meet Triss. Note that in this visualization we are showing the default, reality timeline and all links are drawn with 100% opacity. We can also observe all single-entity events in the narrative in this visualization. In the second timeline, the trolls reject Geralt’s solution to their conflict. Fig. 6 shows a visualization of this unfavorable outcome as diegetic timeline overlaid on top of the reality timeline. While most of the events are same in both timelines, the diegetic timeline ends at the event “Speak to She-Troll.” The reduced opacity of the reality timeline allows the user to compare common sections of the two timelines, even when one of them is smaller than the other. In the third timeline, Margot refuses to help Geralt preventing him from progressing further on his quest. This is the shortest timeline in our narrative.\n\nFrom ’’Yarn: Generating Storyline Visualizations Using HTN Planning”:\n\nFor our second example we use a fictional narrative scenario based on the popular sitcom Friends. In this narrative, Ross’s plan is to take Rachel on a date. To do so, he must acquire more information about her, find some way of talking to her, ensure she is positively disposed towards him, and eventually ask her out. He can acquire more information about her in a number of ways including calling her mother, or asking Phoebe about her by either call or text. To ensure she is in a positive mood, he can either give her a gift or say nice things to her, and finally he can either ask her out himself or ask for Phoebe’s help. To illustrate causality of events in the narrative timeline, we have set up the operator functions for Rachel such that she is more inclined to say yes to Ross if he talks to her mother rather than requesting Phoebe’s help. Additionally, Rachel’s probability of accepting Ross’s proposal is also dependent on how impressed she is by him when he asks her. There are four choice points in this narrative: three for Ross, and one for Rachel. The choices made by Ross create 12 alternate timelines, each illustrating a different way in which he can ask Rachel out. Towards the end of each timeline Rachel can decide to either reply yes to Ross, or reply no, creating a total of 24 timelines. Fig. 7 shows a visualization where Rachel agrees to go out with Ross in both timelines. While the timelines result in the same outcome, and visually look the same, we can inspect the labels on top of the events in Ross’s timeline to identify the differences. Lighter labels correspond to the reality timeline, while darker labels correspond to the diegetic timeline. In the reality timeline, Ross decided to give a gift to Rachel after talking to her mom, while in the diegetic timeline he decided to act friendly with her. Fig. 8 shows another visualization for the same narrative. In this example we can see the effect of causal conditions set in the operator functions for Rachel. In the reality timeline, Rachel decided not to go out with Ross because he asked Phoebe for help by messaging her. On the other hand, she agreed to go out with him in the diegetic timeline because in this case Ross decided to talk to her mother.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom ’’Yarn: Generating Storyline Visualizations Using HTN Planning”:\n\n\n\nUntitled"

The first set of graphs is taken from “defacto-benchmark” graphs, including the Hachul library, Walshaw’s Graph Partitioning Archive, the sparse matrices collection [6] and the network repository [24]. These include two types of graphs that have been extensively studied in graph drawing research: grid-like graphs and scale-free graphs.\n\n\n\nExample Figures"

We compare the nine combinations of schemes to see how close to the conjectured value each of them is able to get, for various sizes of complete graphs up to \\(n = 50\\). We indicate how many crossings are obtained after the initial embedding, as well as at the conclusion of the heuristic. We also provide the runtimes, again separated into time spent producing the initial embedding, and time spent in the main loop of the heuristic.\n\n\nComplete bipartite graphs - Much like the complete graphs, the crossing number of the complete bipartite graph \\(K_{n1,n2}\\) is only known in general for \\(n_1 ≤ 6\\), but the value is conjectured and typically assumed to be correct. Again, we compare the nine combinations of schemes to see how close to the conjectured value they can get for values up to \\(n_1,n_2 = 40\\), and report the same data as for the Complete graphs.\n\n\nThe crossing number of the complete graph \\(K_n\\) is conjectured (e.g. see Guy [25]) to be equal to \\(H(n) := 1/4 \\left\\lfloor n/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor (n − 1)/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor(n − 2)/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor (n − 3)/2\\right\\rfloor\\). Although this conjecture is widely believed to be correct, it has only been confirmed for \\(n ≤ 12\\) despite considerable effort to extend the results further [30]. We ran the graphs \\(K_n\\) for \\(5 ≤ n ≤ 50\\). Each graph was run with 100 random permutations and the minimum found solution was compared to \\(H(n)\\) by computing the percent relative deviation from \\(H(n)\\)… For these graphs, we observe that when \\(n\\) was odd, every scheme combination was able to obtain a drawing with \\(H(n)\\) crossings. However, when \\(n\\) was even, each scheme reached a value which was usually very close but not equal to \\(H(n)\\).\n\n\nThe crossing number of the complete bipartite graph \\(K_{n_1,n_2}\\) is conjectured (e.g. see Zarankiewicz [35]) to be equal to \\(Z(n_1, n_2) := \\left\\lfloor n_1/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor (n_1 − 1)/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor n_2/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor (n_2 − 1)/2\\right\\rfloor\\). We ran the graphs \\(K_{n_1,n_2}\\) for \\(5 ≤ n1 ≤ n2 ≤ 40\\). Each graph was run with 100 random permutations and the minimum found solution was compared to \\(Z(n_1,n_2)\\)… As can be seen in Table 6, QuickCross was successful in obtaining the conjectured optimum in all cases and for all scheme combinations, except \\(K_{30,30}\\) and \\(K_{40,40}\\)"

The probability that two airports are connected by a direct flight is strongly related to their geographical distance: Most direct flights are relatively short, and only few large hub airports are connected by direct long-range flights. The distances in the edge-repulsion LinLog layout resemble the relative geographical distances of the airports remarkably closely, given that the graph does not contain any explicit information about geographical distances.\n\n\nDictionary (Figure 7): The nodes represent terms in the Online Dictionary of Library and Information Science (ODLIS), and the edges represent hyperlinks. A hyperlink between two terms exists if one term is used to describe the meaning of the other term, and thus connects semantically related terms. The edge-repulsion LinLog layout indeed groups semantically related terms, which is better reflected in the VRML file on the supplementary web page than in Figure 7(c). Such a grouping is useful, for example, for discovering the global topic areas (like publishing, printing, information technology, etc.), for identifying entry points for the exploration of topics, or for finding semantically related terms even if they are not explicitly linked.\n\nFrom “A Quality Metric for Visualization of Clusters in Graphs”:\n\nWe re-used some datasets from the validation experiments and created some new ones, listed in Table 2. We also selected real world graph datasets with existing vertex categorization, which are listed under the double line in Table 2. The datasets were taken from Pajek [2] and Stanford Network Analysis Project’s (SNAP) repository [23, 40].\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “Energy Models for Graph Clustering”:\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-08-17 at 4.05.25 PM.png\n\n\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-08-17 at 4.06.19 PM.png\n\n\n=== STOP RENDERING ===\nhttp://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/\nDirect flights between US airports (332 nodes, 2126 edges).

As described in Section 2, prior work considers relations between entities either as semantic relations based on linguistic knowledge or regards two entities as related due to their presence in the same document. The often ungrammatical structure of utterances in verbatim text transcripts (including non-standard lexical items, syntactic patterns, interruptions, repetitions, and crosstalk) requires a simple extralinguistic model. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a model that bounds the scope in which we consider two entities to be related, using a distance threshold (maxDist). Our method creates a pair of entities if the entities appear in the same sentences within maxDist words of one another.\n\n\nHowever, not only are frequent entity-pairs important, but also pairs that are semantically similar (e.g., cut $5 trillion, cut $4 trillion). These often present opposing speaker opinions about a given topic. To maximize the chance that entity-pairs represent true semantic relations, we set the default value of maxDist to a low value (5 words). To vary the granularity of the analysis, the parameter can be changed interactively depending on the analysis task and data. Nevertheless, some infrequent longer-distance entity-pairs are discovered which do not represent salient relations. To reduce their impact, we calculate the average observed distance (in words) for each entity pair. We use both frequency and average distance in the visualization to reflect the strength of the entity-pair.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “NEREx: Named-Entity Relationship Exploration in Multi-Party Conversations”:\n\n\n\ncgf13181-fig-0004-m.jpg\n\n\nEntity graph of the first first presidential debate between Trump and Clinton\n\n\n\ncgf13181-fig-0006-m.jpg\n\n\nEntity graph of the same debate, focusing on the concept of taxes"

Body\n\nStatistics\n\n\n\nfour_in_one.svg\n\n\n\n\nDescriptions from Literature\nFrom “A branch-and-cut approach to the crossing number problem”:\n\nTo test the performance of our new algorithm, we used a benchmark set of graphs of the University of Rome III, introduced in [11]. The set contains 11 389 graphs that consist of 10 to 100 nodes and 9 to 158 edges. These graphs were generated from a core set of 112 “real life” graphs used in database design and software engineering applications. Most of the graphs are sparse, which is a common property in most application areas of automatic graph drawing. The average ratio between the number of edges and the number of nodes of the graphs from the benchmark set is about 1.35.\n\nFrom “Layer-free upward crossing minimization”:\n\nThe Rome graphs [Di Battista et al. 1997] are a widely used benchmark set in graph drawing, obtained from a basic set of 112 real-world graphs. It contains 11,528 instances with 10 through 100 nodes and 9 through 158 edges. Although the graphs are originally undirected, they have been used as directed graphs—by artificially directing the edges according to the node order given in the input files—for showing the performance of the mixed-upward planarization approach [Eiglsperger et al. 2003]. In this case, all edges are directed and the graphs are acyclic; hence, the mixed-upward planarization approach turns into an upward planarization method.\n\nFrom “A New Approach to Exact Crossing Minimization”:\n\nWe say graphs are trivial, if they are planar or if the heuristic achieves a planarization with only one crossing, as in these cases we need not prove optimality. The Rome library contains 7172 non-trivial graphs.\n\nFrom “An Experimental Comparison of Four Graph Drawing Algorithms”\n\nOur test graph generation strategy is as follows. First, we have focused on the important application area of database and software visualization, where Entity-Relationship diagrams and Data-Flow diagrams are usually displayed with orthogonal drawings. Second, we have collected 112 “real life” graphs with number of vertices between 10 and 100, from now on called core graphs, from the following sources:\n\n\n• 54% of the graphs have been obtained from major Italian software companies (especially from Database Informatica) and large government organization (including the Italian Internal Revenue Service and the Italian National Advisory Council for Computer Applications in the Government (Autorita’ per l’Informatica nella Pubblica Amministrazione)); • 33% of the graphs were taken from well-known reference books in software engineering [18] and database design [1], and from journal articles on software visualization in the recent issues of Information Systems and the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering; • 13% of the graphs were extracted from theses in software and database visualization written by students at the University of Rome “La Sapienza”.\n\n\nOur approach is based on the following scheme. We defined several primitive operations for updating graphs, which correspond to the typical operations performed by designers of Entity-Relationship and Data-Flow Diagrams, and attributed a certain probability to each of them. More specifically, the updating primitives we have used are the following: InsertEdge, which inserts a new edge between two existing vertices; DeleteEdge, which deletes an existing edge; InsertVertex, which splits an existing edge into two edges by inserting a new vertex; DeleteVertex, which deletes a vertex and all its incident edges; and MakeVertex, which creates a new vertex and connects it to a subset of vertices. The test graphs were then generated in several iterations starting from the core graphs by applying random sequences of operations with a “genetic” mechanism. Namely, at each iteration a new set of test graphs was obtained by applying a random sequence of operations to the current test set. Each new graph was then evaluated for “suitability”, and those found not suitable were discarded. The probability of each primitive operation was varied at the end of each iteration. The evaluation of the suitability of the generated graphs was conducted using both objective and subjective analyses. The objective analysis consisted of determining whether the new graph had similar structural properties with respect to the core graph it was derived from. We have taken into account parameters like the average ratio between number of vertices and number of edges and the average number of biconnected components. The subjective analysis consisted in a visual inspection of the new graph and an assessment by expert users of Entity-Relationship and Data-Flow diagrams of its similarity to a “real-life” diagram. For obvious reasons, the subjective analysis has been done on a randomly selected subset of the graphs.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom ”An Experimental Comparison of Four Graph Drawing Algorithms”:\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFrom “Experimental Analysis of the Accessibility of Drawings with Few Segments”:\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFrom: Deep Neural Network for DrawiNg Networks, (DNN)2:\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFig 5.

    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Collection process\nThe information we collected is a by-product of a larger systematic review we conducted related to graph layout algorithms, which included 196 papers The following figure shows the original data collection process (from [@dibartolomeo2024evaluating]):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The sources used for the collection of papers. We started from the last 7 years of graph drawing, then integrated with the results from IEEE and Eurographics search, and then we also included all the most cited papers in Graph Drawing. The final result was 196 papers containing layout algorithm evaluations.\n\n\n\nThe core of our data collection was the last seven years of Graph Drawing proceedings (264 papers in total), filtering out papers without computational evaluations. We further expanded our graph layout algorithm papers collection by searching IEEE Xplore and Wiley digital libraries to include papers from TVCG and CGF. Then, we checked all the citations in the papers we collected from Graph Drawing, and added to our collection all the papers that were cited more than 4 times in the last 6 years of graph drawing — to make sure we included algorithm papers that were important, but not published at GD, on IEEE Xplore or on the Wiley digital library. For each paper, we collected which features were handled by the graph layout algorithm presented, and what dataset was used in the evaluation. When collecting features, we always prioritized the authors’ own wording and description of the features. The tagging of the papers was done by two people at the same time, over two different passes for sanity-checking purposes. We used the following process to track down the datasets used in computational evaluations: (1) we first looked for official or linked supplemental material, (2) we next Googled the dataset or paper name, (3) finally, we emailed the authors. When in doubt about the artifact replication policy, we asked the owners or authors by email. In cases where it was explicitly mentioned that approval should be received before redistribution, we did not redistribute the datasets. However, if we received approval or did not receive an answer and found no explicit policy preventing redistribution, we collected and stored the dataset to preserve it for future researchers. If any dataset owner or author discovers their own work in our collection and would like it removed, we kindly request that they contact us (see our authorship statement above), and we will promptly remove it. Furthermore, we want to emphasize that we do not assert any ownership rights over the datasets listed.\nFigure 1 shows the distribution of papers across different venues:\n\n{ \n  let d = []\n  let allbenchmarkdatasets = [...new Set(literature.map(l =&gt; l[\"Conference\"].split(\",\").map(d =&gt; d.trim())).flat().map(a =&gt; {\n    if (a == \"EuroVis\") return \"Computer Graphics Forum\"\n    else return a;\n  }))].filter(a =&gt; a != \"\")\n\n  for (let dataset of allbenchmarkdatasets){\n    let literature_entries_with_this_dataset = literature.filter(l =&gt; l[\"Conference\"].includes(dataset))\n\n    if (literature_entries_with_this_dataset.length &lt; 2) continue;\n\n    d.push({\"dataset\": dataset, \"count\": literature_entries_with_this_dataset.length})\n  }\n  \n  return Plot.plot({\n    \n    color: {\n      scheme: \"category10\"\n    },\n    y: {},\n    marks: [\n      Plot.barX(d, {x: \"count\", y: \"dataset\", fill: \"dataset\",inset: 2, sort: {y: \"x\", reverse: true}}),\n      Plot.axisY({label: null, lineWidth: 12, marginLeft: 150, marginTop: 20}),\n      Plot.text(['Venues where the papers where published'], {frameAnchor: \"Top\",dy: -10})\n    ]\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Chart showing the distribution of papers collected across different venues. While the most occurrences are from Graph Drawing, a significant number of entries comes from TVCG and CGF.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows the distribution of collected papers’ publication date:\n\n{ \n  let d = []\n  let year_range = [1980, 2024]\n  for (let year = year_range[0]; year &lt; year_range[1]; year++){\n    let literature_entries_with_this_year = literature.filter(l =&gt; parseInt(l[\"Year\"]) == year);\n\n    d.push({\"year\": year, \"count\": literature_entries_with_this_year.length})\n  }\n  \n  return Plot.plot({\n    color: {\n      range: [\"steelblue\"]\n    },\n    height: 500,\n    marks: [\n      Plot.barX(d, {x: \"count\", y: \"year\", fill: \"steelblue\", inset: 2}),\n      Plot.axisY({\n        label: null, \n        lineWidth: 12, \n        marginLeft: 150, \n        marginTop: 20, \n        tickFormat: year =&gt; year % 5 === 0 ? \"\" + year : \"\", // Only show ticks for years divisible by 5\n      }),\n      Plot.text(['Year of publication of the papers included in the survey'], {frameAnchor: \"Top\", dy: -10})\n    ]\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Chart showing the distribution of papers collected by year of publication. The bulk of the papers we collected were fairly recent—indeed, our collection process focused mostly on the last 7 years (2016-2023 at the time of writing) of Graph Drawing proceedings, but thanks to the snowballing process we used we were able to include many papers from previous years.\n\n\n\n\nAfter collecting the datasets, we looked more in-depth into their contents, running analysis on a number of statistics associated with the graphs contained in them. Based on common metrics reported in @dibartolomeo2024evaluating, we collect and plot statistics about the datasets: distribution of number of nodes, edges, mean degree and maximum degree. Additionally, we collected all the descriptions of the datasets we could find in the literature, which can contain relevant information about the origin of the dataset or its content, and we collected figures representing the content of the datasets taken from papers that use it, to give a visual representation and an immediate idea of the graphs contained in it."

    "text": "Further complicating the replicability and reproducibility issues previously outlined is the problem of storing data in a consistent format. Datasets cited in different papers link to downloads for which the graph structure is very difficult to piece together (for instance, if it is in an uncommon format)—most commonly, paper authors write code to extract this structure for their specific needs, but this code is often tedious to recreate (if the authors went through the trouble of meticulously describing their process in the paper) or difficult and time-consuming to reappropriate (if it is contained in their supplemental materials, and they still exist on the web).

    "text": "1 Motivation and Background\nThis work stems from the challenges we encountered in finding datasets tailored to test graph layout algorithms. When developing a graph layout algorithm which handles specific features (such as layers, or clusters), it is essential to have a benchmark dataset that reflects these features. While conducting our own evaluations, we found it difficult to find datasets that would incorporate features that we needed. This submission is part of an ongoing effort to keep a curated list of datasets.\nOur work focuses on providing a graph benchmark collection that categorizes datasets by how they organize their graphs and emphasizes their features. We aim to facilitate researchers’ choice of benchmarks to reflect real use cases or allow comparisons to other algorithms in their respective fields. Although a number of graph repositories exist, their target and objectives are not always aligned with the needs of graph drawing researchers. While the scope of this work revolves around compiling graphs and networks used in the graph drawing literature, we highlight that other, adjacent fields have also created similar repositories tailored to different needs. For example, the Network Repository consists of a comprehensive collection of datasets that contain many attributes and are used for benchmarking in machine learning, data mining, and many other network applications [@nr]. In biology, the KEGG Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes contains network information relevant to biological pathways [@kegg]. Some general-purpose collections used in network science are also relevant to our discussion. Among the most famous ones, the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection, the Stanford Network Analysis Project (SNAP), and the Pajek collection stand out since they propose large compilations of datasets that often come from diverse sources. The Open Graph Benchmark collection from @hu2020 is also worth mentioning. It provides an important infrastructure for evaluating machine learning methods on graph-structured data, including datasets, tasks, and evaluation metrics, but it is not focused on layout quality or human-perceived readability of graph visualizations. Our work complements such efforts by specifically targeting datasets designed to evaluate the perceptual and aesthetic dimensions of layout algorithms, which are not addressed in @hu2020. Much simpler examples of similar collections can be found in curated lists of links on GitHub, often referred to as awesome lists, where a short comment usually accompanies every entry (for instance, here and here). The purpose and scope of such repositories is provided with more depth in ?@sec-established-network-repositories.\nSuch lists can serve as great tools to find particular case studies, but they do not serve the same purpose as a uniform collection like Rome-Lib: a collection of graphs with similar features that can be used to test an algorithm on thousands of graphs with increasing nodes. Rome-Lib is hosted on the main website of the Graph Drawing website, as proof of its usefulness as a benchmark dataset, together with the AT&T graphs and the random DAGs. Another example is the Graph Partitioning Archive, also known as the Walshaw Collection, which compiles relevant graphs and partitioning algorithms from disparate sources in the relevant literature [@walshaw2000]. The uniformity of such collections allows scientists to easily run thousand of tests on similar graphs, allowing to test the scalability of an algorithm varying density, number of nodes and number of edges — as opposed to the previously mentioned collections, where the focus is on the diversity of the graphs. See ?@sec-uniform-benchmark-datasets for more information on this topic.\nWe care particularly about the reproducibility of past and future research. A dataset that has been used in an evaluation and is now unaccessible greatly hinders the reproducibility of the evaluation, and in the worst case it makes it impossible to reproduce, and, as such, much less meaningful. Losing a dataset to link rot is an unfortunately common problem in the digital age, as URLs change, websites go down, and data is lost. One example of this is the Open Graph Archive from @bachmaier2012, which was a project to create a graph database that categorizes, analyses, and visualizes graphs uploaded from the community, a laudable effort now rendered unfortunately inaccessible. For more discussion, see ?@sec-lost.\nWe tried to mitigate the problem of lost datasets by documenting what we could still find about them. For every dataset that we found that is now lost or inaccessible, we documented every detail we could find about it in literature, including descriptions and pictures of the rendered graphs, so that we can conserve a hint of what the dataset contained. We also reached out to colleagues in other universities who we knew had worked with certain datasets in the past, and asked if they could check their internal storage — for example, shared drives or old project folders — to see if the data was still available. In a couple of cases, this led to successfull outcomes: see Storylines (Movie Plots).\nWe store our collection on the Open Science Framework (OSF), which is the currently recommended solution in the VIS community for long-term archival of research data. As per OSF’s backup and preservation policy, storage and open access is guaranteed for the next 50 years.\nIn this context, it is also worth mentioning that in recent years there have been several initiatives aimed at encouraging care for replicability in research. The Graphics Replicability Stamp is one of these, meant to be an endorsement of the replicability of the results presented in a paper, which ensures the replicability of the results of a paper through an additional review process. Another similar intiative are the ACM badges, or the SIGMOD availability and reproducibility initiative, which goes one step further and publishes full reports commenting on how reproducible a paper is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintenance plans and contribution to the repository\n\n\n\nContributions to the dataset collection (corrections, integrations, replacement) are most welcome — and strongly encouraged. However, to ensure data quality and avoid accidental overwriting or inconsistency, we don’t allow direct edits to the files by everyone. Instead, there are two main ways to contribute:\n\nPull requests: If you prefer to fill in all the information yourself, you can submit a pull request directly to the repository. The data for both the papers and the datasets is stored in CSV format, available here.\nGitHub issues: If you’d rather just point us to a new dataset or share some additional info (e.g., missing metadata, clarifications, or links), we’ve created an issue template to make that easier. We’ll then take care of adding the dataset and filling in whatever information we can find or infer.\n\nEven without external contributions, we actively monitor the space and try to keep the repository up to date as new datasets emerge. And if none of the options above work for you, feel free to just reach out to us — we’re happy to handle things more informally as well.\nThat said, it’s worth noting a clear limitation: this collection does not aim to be exhaustive. The starting point for the dataset list was a literature review covering a few hundred papers, which means it’s entirely possible that some benchmarks were missed — especially if they weren’t cited often or were introduced in more obscure venues. For this reason, contributions from the community are especially valuable to help fill in the gaps and keep the resource as useful and complete as possible.\n\n\nThis work proposes a working classification of datasets and collections based on their structure while also providing a higher emphasis on the features and usage within the literature of our field. Our collection is offered as a complement to the previously mentioned collections, as we intend to aid researchers in finding graphs in the context of layout algorithms and network visualization, with a focus on encouraging replicability."

All the other datasets are used only once in the collection.\n\n\n\n\nIn the data we collected, the most used dataset is Rome-Lib, followed by assorted collaboration networks (which in many cases refers to datasets of academic collaborations such as dblp or vispubdata). The third most used dataset is from C.Walshaw - it is important to note that the Walshaw dataset is available as part of other collections - for instance, its graphs are found in SNAP. However, during the collection process, we preferred giving precedence to how the authors reported their own information. Thus, if the authors claimed the data was from the Walshaw collection, we reported it as such.\nIn some cases, we grouped together datasets that share similar structural or contextual characteristics under a broader category — for example, Social Networks includes graphs from multiple sources such as Facebook, DBLP, and others. These graphs are often used interchangeably in layout evaluation papers, and while most papers only use one of them, we grouped them to reflect the broader trend of using social networks as a class of input graphs. We note, however, that this grouping may affect how the most-used datasets are ranked. In particular, counts for grouped categories like Social Networks reflect cumulative usage across all sources in the group, rather than implying that all papers used the full set.\nFor each of the datasets collected as part of our process, we conducted a brief analysis of their contents. Where possible, the analysis includes information about the number of nodes per graph, the source of the dataset, which papers have used the dataset and what graph features they took into account.\nIn the following sections, the reader will find details about the classifications and datasets in detail. Each dataset gets a dedicated, collapsible section, that contains the following information:\n\nA brief summary description of the dataset, the reasons for its popularity, and notes about how it was created or collected.\nMetadata containing:\n\nThe original source of the dataset.\nLinks to download the dataset in different formats, provided from our OSF repository.\nThe size of the dataset.\nThe original paper where the dataset was first introduced.\nA list of papers that have used the dataset, together with what features their graph layout algorithm handles.\n\nCharts illustrating node and edge count distribution through the dataset, mean and maximum distribution.\nDescriptions of the datasets lifted directly from the literature, which can help shine light on the content and properties of the dataset, how it was used in previous literature, or how it originated.\nFigures collected from the literature, such as visualizations of the graphs, or other relevant information. The visualizations can help a reader looking for a specific type of graph to quickly identify if the dataset is relevant to their research.\n\n                               \n\n\nThe datasets we collected are divided in different categories: the categorization we used is the same as the one used in @dibartolomeo2024evaluating. The following is a brief explanation of the categories used, which are explained in deeper detail in each one of the corresponding chapters.\n\nUniform Benchmark (Section 1.1.1): Datasets that are standalone widely used collections of graphs featuring uniform characteristics - usually simple, generic graphs, often used in evaluations that run over thousands of graphs to report average completion times, or other experiments where the reported metrics are usually aggregated.\nEstablished Network Repository (Section 1.1.2): A collection of individual, or groups of graphs, part of a larger repository. These datasets are often used in evaluations that require a diverse set of graphs, or when the evaluation is focused on a specific type of graph. These collections usually also report on graphs with their own statistics or visualizations, providing a summary of the dataset. This category also includes Subsets (Section 1.1.2.10).\nSingle Graphs (Section 1.1.3): The data used is comprised of one individual graph, which often contains special characteristics making it particularly relevant for the evaluation at hand.\nAggregate Collections (Section 1.1.4): Collections of graphs focusing on one specific context (such as forum posts, or airline routes) due to the given context having a special set of features that is relevant for a graph layout algorithm.\n\nThe type of collection informs various aspects of an evaluation, such as which results are relevant to report. For this discussion, we refer to @dibartolomeo2024evaluating, where the authors link the type of collection in the context of graph layout evaluations.\nThe following visualization shows the amount of datasets we collected per category:\n\n{ \n  let d = []\n  \n  let collection_type = benchmark_datasets.map(a =&gt; a[\"Type of Collection\"]);\n\n  for (let c of [... new Set(collection_type)]){\n    if (c == \"Skip\" || c == \"Missed it\") continue;\n    let count = collection_type.filter(a =&gt; a == c).length;\n    if (c.includes(\"No report\")) c = \"Established Network Repository\";\n    if (c.includes(\"Lost\")) continue;\n    d.push({\"collection_type\": c, \"count\": count})\n  }\n  \n  return Plot.plot({\n    color: {\n      scheme: \"Tableau10\" \n    },\n    marks: [\n      Plot.barX(d, {x: \"count\", y: \"collection_type\", fill: \"collection_type\", inset: 2, sort: {y: \"x\", reverse: true}}),\n      Plot.axisY({label: null, lineWidth: 12, marginLeft: 150}),\n    ]\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Occurrences of datasets we collected per category. Unform benchmark datasets were the majority.\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, some of the datasets used in layout algorithm evaluations are not accessible anymore. Where possible, we still collected and reported all the information contained in the papers about the datasets, so that we can conserve an idea of what they contained. This phenomenon, as well as the information we could collect, is discussed in Lost and Unavailable Datasets (Section 1.1.5).\n\n{ \n  let d = []\n  \n  let collection_type = benchmark_datasets.map(a =&gt; a[\"Type of Collection\"]);\n\n  for (let c of [... new Set(collection_type)]){\n    if (c == \"Skip\" || c == \"Missed it\") continue;\n    let count = collection_type.filter(a =&gt; a == c).length;\n    if (c.includes(\"No report\")) c = \"Established Network Repository\";\n    if (!c.includes(\"Lost\")) continue;\n    d.push({\"collection_type\": c, \"count\": count})\n  }\n  \n  return Plot.plot({\n    color: {\n      scheme: \"PiYg\" \n    },\n    x: {\n      domain: [0, 15]\n    },\n    marks: [\n      Plot.barX(d, {x: \"count\", y: \"collection_type\", fill: \"collection_type\", inset: 2, sort: {y: \"x\", reverse: true}}),\n      Plot.axisY({label: null, lineWidth: 12, marginLeft: 150}),\n    ]\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Unfortunately, 9 of the datasets we found being used in the literature were either lost or no longer accessible.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we include a discussion on Custom-made Datasets (Section 1.1.6), synthetically generated datasets for the purpose of an experiment.\nEach dataset also contains a number of graph features specific to the graphs contained in it. Authors might want to use a dataset that contains a specific feature, such as a graph with a high number of nodes, or a graph with a specific structure. The following interactive filtering systems allows for filtering of datasets (and papers) based on the features they contain.\n\n\n\n\n\nType to search for datasets by name or feature. Results will appear here.\n\n\n\nconsole.log(benchmark_datasets)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocument.getElementById('dataset-search').addEventListener('input', function(e) {\n    const query = e.target.value.toLowerCase();\n    // Example: filter and log matching dataset names\n    const matches = benchmark_datasets.filter(d =&gt; {\n      const nameMatch = d.Name && d.Name.toLowerCase().includes(query);\n      const featureMatch = d[\"graph features handled\"] && d[\"graph features handled\"].toLowerCase().includes(query);\n      return nameMatch || featureMatch;\n    });\n    // You can replace this with code to update the UI with the filtered results\n    const resultsContainer = document.getElementById('search-results');\n    resultsContainer.innerHTML = ''; // Clear previous results\n    if (matches.length &gt; 0 && query.length &gt; 0) {\n        resultsContainer.innerHTML = `&lt;strong&gt;Found ${matches.length} matching datasets:&lt;/strong&gt;`;\n        matches.forEach(match =&gt; {\n            const resultItem = document.createElement('div');\n            resultItem.className = 'search-result-item';\n            resultItem.innerHTML = `&lt;a class=\"dataset-link\" href=\"#${name_cleanup(match.Name)}\"&gt;${match.Name}&lt;/a&gt; - ${match[\"graph features handled\"] || \"No features listed\"}`;\n            resultsContainer.appendChild(resultItem);\n        });\n    } else if (query.length &gt; 0) {\n        resultsContainer.innerHTML = '&lt;i&gt;No matching datasets found.&lt;/i&gt;';\n    } else {\n        resultsContainer.innerHTML = '&lt;i&gt;Type to search for datasets by name or feature.

The left column contains all the properties used to tag graphs in the datasets (additional information about the nature of these tags can be found in ?@sec-collection-process and ?@sec-data-processing). Each tag has an associated checkbox: selecting a tag (or more than one) will filter the datasets and papers to only show those that contain the selected tags. The middle column contains the datasets, and the right column contains the papers. Clicking on a dataset or paper will scroll the page to the corresponding section in the paper. The datasets and papers are sorted alphabetically by name and citation name, respectively. The tags, datasets, and papers are generated from the data in the repository, and are updated automatically when the data changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\nDatsets\n\n\nPapers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirlines, Migrations, and Air Traffic\n\n\nAmazon\n\n\nAssorted Collaboration Network\n\n\nAssorted Fiscal

synthetic, or randomly generated graphs. These benchmarks are often used in large-scale evaluations where experiments are run on thousands of graphs, and results are reported as aggregated metrics such as average running time or layout quality scores.\nWhat distinguishes these benchmarks is that they are designed to test the general performance of layout algorithms across a wide range of input sizes and densities, rather than being tied to a particular real-world context or graph semantics. This is different from other collections presented later in this section, which may focus on graphs with specific structural patterns (e.g., social networks, hierarchical trees, storyline structures) or graphs drawn from a single domain.\nThe first of these collapsible sections is shown already expanded, to give an example of the content that can be found in each of them. The content is generated dynamically based on the data we collected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRome-Lib\n\n\n\n\n\nRome-Lib is, as previously discussed, the most common benchmark dataset, due to its already established popularity, its ease of use and access, and the many properties that are already known about it. It was first introduced in [@DiBattista1997b] and presented in their paper ”An experimental comparison of four graph drawing algorithms”. Mostly “real” networks such as software companies, government, software engineering books, database design, and journal articles on visualization.

The set contains 11 389 graphs that consist of 10 to 100 nodes and 9 to 158 edges. These graphs were generated from a core set of 112 “real life” graphs used in database design and software engineering applications. Most of the graphs are sparse, which is a common property in most application areas of automatic graph drawing. The average ratio between the number of edges and the number of nodes of the graphs from the benchmark set is about 1.35.\n\nFrom “Layer-free upward crossing minimization”:\n\nThe Rome graphs [Di Battista et al. 1997] are a widely used benchmark set in graph drawing, obtained from a basic set of 112 real-world graphs. It contains 11,528 instances with 10 through 100 nodes and 9 through 158 edges. Although the graphs are originally undirected, they have been used as directed graphs—by artificially directing the edges according to the node order given in the input files—for showing the performance of the mixed-upward planarization approach [Eiglsperger et al. 2003]. In this case, all edges are directed and the graphs are acyclic; hence, the mixed-upward planarization approach turns into an upward planarization method.\n\nFrom “A New Approach to Exact Crossing Minimization”:\n\nWe say graphs are trivial, if they are planar or if the heuristic achieves a planarization with only one crossing, as in these cases we need not prove optimality. The Rome library contains 7172 non-trivial graphs.\n\nFrom “An Experimental Comparison of Four Graph Drawing Algorithms”\n\nOur test graph generation strategy is as follows. First, we have focused on the important application area of database and software visualization, where Entity-Relationship diagrams and Data-Flow diagrams are usually displayed with orthogonal drawings. Second, we have collected 112 “real life” graphs with number of vertices between 10 and 100, from now on called core graphs, from the following sources:\n\n\n• 54% of the graphs have been obtained from major Italian software companies (especially from Database Informatica) and large government organization (including the Italian Internal Revenue Service and the Italian National Advisory Council for Computer Applications in the Government (Autorita’ per l’Informatica nella Pubblica Amministrazione)); • 33% of the graphs were taken from well-known reference books in software engineering [18] and database design [1], and from journal articles on software visualization in the recent issues of Information Systems and the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering; • 13% of the graphs were extracted from theses in software and database visualization written by students at the University of Rome “La Sapienza”.\n\n\nOur approach is based on the following scheme. We defined several primitive operations for updating graphs, which correspond to the typical operations performed by designers of Entity-Relationship and Data-Flow Diagrams, and attributed a certain probability to each of them. More specifically, the updating primitives we have used are the following: InsertEdge, which inserts a new edge between two existing vertices; DeleteEdge, which deletes an existing edge; InsertVertex, which splits an existing edge into two edges by inserting a new vertex; DeleteVertex, which deletes a vertex and all its incident edges; and MakeVertex, which creates a new vertex and connects it to a subset of vertices. The test graphs were then generated in several iterations starting from the core graphs by applying random sequences of operations with a “genetic” mechanism. Namely, at each iteration a new set of test graphs was obtained by applying a random sequence of operations to the current test set. Each new graph was then evaluated for “suitability”, and those found not suitable were discarded. The probability of each primitive operation was varied at the end of each iteration. The evaluation of the suitability of the generated graphs was conducted using both objective and subjective analyses. The objective analysis consisted of determining whether the new graph had similar structural properties with respect to the core graph it was derived from. We have taken into account parameters like the average ratio between number of vertices and number of edges and the average number of biconnected components. The subjective analysis consisted in a visual inspection of the new graph and an assessment by expert users of Entity-Relationship and Data-Flow diagrams of its similarity to a “real-life” diagram. For obvious reasons, the subjective analysis has been done on a randomly selected subset of the graphs.\n\n\n\n\nFrom ”An Experimental Comparison of Four Graph Drawing Algorithms”:\n\n\n\nFrom “Experimental Analysis of the Accessibility of Drawings with Few Segments”:\n\n\n\nFrom: Deep Neural Network for DrawiNg Networks, (DNN)2:\n\n\n\nFig 5.

We considered two typical contexts where DAGs play a fundamental role, namely software engineering and project planning.\n\n\nThe first set of test DAGs are what we call the North DAGs. They are obtained from a collection of directed graphs [28], that North collected at AT&T Bell Labs by running for two years Draw DAG, an e-mail graph drawing service that accepts directed graphs formatted as e-mail messages and returns messages with the corresponding drawings [27].\n\n\nOriginally, the North DAGs consisted of 5114 directed graphs, whose number of vertices varied in the range 1 … 7602. However, the density of the directed graphs with a number of vertices that did not fall in the range 10 … 100 was very low (see also the statistics in [28]); since such directed graphs represent a very sparse statistical population we decided to discard them. Then we noted that many directed graphs were isomorphic; since the vertices of the directed graphs have labels associated with them, the problem is tractable. For each isomorphism class, we kept only one representative directed graph. Also, we deleted the directed graphs where subgraphs were specified as clusters, to be drawn in their own distinct rectangular region of the layout, because constrained algorithms are beyond the scope of this study. This filtering left us with 1277 directed graphs.\n\n\nStill, 491 directed graphs were not connected and this was a problem for running algorithms implemented in G D W (they assume input directed graphs to be connected). Instead of discarding the directed graphs, we followed a more practical approach, by randomly adding a minimum set of directed edges that makes each directed graph connected. Finally, we made the directed graph acyclic, where necessary, by applying some heuristics for inverting the direction of a small subset of edges.\n\n\nWe then ran a first set of experiments and produced the statistics by grouping the DAGs by number of vertices. Although the comparison among the algorithms looked consistent (the produced plots never oddly overlapped), each single plot was not satisfactory, because it showed peaks and valleys. We went back to study the test suite and observed that grouping them by number of vertices was not the best approach. In fact, the North DAGs come from very heterogeneous sources, mainly representing different phases of various software engineering projects; as a result, directed graphs with more or less the same number of vertices may be either very dense or very sparse.\n\n\nSince most of the analyzed quality measures strongly depend on the number of edges of the DAG (e.g. area, number of bends, and number of crossings), we decided that a better approach was to group the DAGs by number of edges. After some tests, we clustered the DAGs into nine groups, each with at least 40 DAGs, so that the number of edges in the DAGs belonging to group i, 1 ≤ i ≤ 9, is in the range 10 i … 10 i+9 (see Fig. 3). The resulting test suite consists of 1158 DAGs, each with edges in the range 10 … 99.\n\nFrom “Layer-Free Upward Crossing Minimization”:\n\nNorth DAGs. The North DAGs have been introduced in an experimental comparison of algorithms for drawing DAGs [Di Battista et al. 2000]. The benchmark set contains 1,158 DAGs collected by Stephen North, which were slightly modified by Di Battista et al. The graphs are grouped into nine sets, where set i contains graphs with 10 i to 10 i+9 arcs for i=1, …, 9.\n\n\n\n\nFrom “Drawing Directed Acyclic Graphs: An Experimental Study”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom “A Natural Quadratic Approach to the Generalized Graph Layering Problem”:\n\n\n\nFrom “A Flow Formulation for Horizontal Coordinate Assignment with Prescribed Width”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth DAGs\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the same collection as AT&T, but referred to as North DAGs in the papers we analyzed.

The instances contain graphs with \\(3 \\leq i \\leq 7\\) and \\(j \\geq i\\) such that \\(ij \\leq 250\\). \\(G_i \\times P_j\\): The Cartesian product of the path on \\(j+1\\) vertices with one of the 21 non-isomorphic connected graphs on 5 vertices, where \\(i\\) denotes which of the 21.

We compare the nine combinations of schemes to see how close to the conjectured value each of them is able to get, for various sizes of complete graphs up to \\(n = 50\\). We indicate how many crossings are obtained after the initial embedding, as well as at the conclusion of the heuristic. We also provide the runtimes, again separated into time spent producing the initial embedding, and time spent in the main loop of the heuristic.\n\n\nComplete bipartite graphs - Much like the complete graphs, the crossing number of the complete bipartite graph \\(K_{n1,n2}\\) is only known in general for \\(n_1 ≤ 6\\), but the value is conjectured and typically assumed to be correct. Again, we compare the nine combinations of schemes to see how close to the conjectured value they can get for values up to \\(n_1,n_2 = 40\\), and report the same data as for the Complete graphs.\n\n\nThe crossing number of the complete graph \\(K_n\\) is conjectured (e.g. see Guy [25]) to be equal to \\(H(n) := 1/4 \\left\\lfloor n/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor (n − 1)/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor(n − 2)/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor (n − 3)/2\\right\\rfloor\\). Although this conjecture is widely believed to be correct, it has only been confirmed for \\(n ≤ 12\\) despite considerable effort to extend the results further [30]. We ran the graphs \\(K_n\\) for \\(5 ≤ n ≤ 50\\). Each graph was run with 100 random permutations and the minimum found solution was compared to \\(H(n)\\) by computing the percent relative deviation from \\(H(n)\\)… For these graphs, we observe that when \\(n\\) was odd, every scheme combination was able to obtain a drawing with \\(H(n)\\) crossings. However, when \\(n\\) was even, each scheme reached a value which was usually very close but not equal to \\(H(n)\\).\n\n\nThe crossing number of the complete bipartite graph \\(K_{n_1,n_2}\\) is conjectured (e.g. see Zarankiewicz [35]) to be equal to \\(Z(n_1, n_2) := \\left\\lfloor n_1/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor (n_1 − 1)/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor n_2/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor (n_2 − 1)/2\\right\\rfloor\\).

This caused the dataset to be lost for a period of time, as none of the papers that used it provided a link to the dataset or stored it as part of their supplemental material.

These interactions between characters can be separated into a series of interaction sessions, each session representing the time span of a set of interacting characters. More precisely, we define an interaction session as a unit which holds three attributes: • initiation time, • duration, and • members. Initiation time corresponds to the time when the interaction session begins. Duration corresponds to the duration of the interaction session. Members corresponds to the set of characters involved in the interaction session. Each interaction session represents a time slot in the data where its members are interacting. Note that any change in the formation of members (e.g., a character leaving or joining) indicates a separate interaction session.\n\n\n\n\nFrom “An Efficient Framework for Generating Storyline Visualizations from Streaming Data”:\n\n\n\nFrom “StoryFlow: Tracking the Evolution of Stories”:\n\n\n\nFrom “Crossing Minimization in Storyline Visualizations”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilitarized Interstate Disputes (MID)\n\n\n\n\n\nCollected as part of the Correlates Of War project, the dataset contains two disconnected Temporal event sequences\n\nOriginally found at: https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/MIDs/\n\n\n\nDownload formatted data:  GEXF GML GRAPHML JSON\n\n\n\nSize: The dataset consists of 2 disconnected temporal event sequence graphs, one with 11,766 nodes and 5,883 edges, and the other with 9,619 nodes and 8,017 edges.\n\n\n\nOrigin paper: \n\n\n\n[@palmer2022]\n\n\nThe MID5 Dataset, 2011–2014: Procedures, coding rules, and description.\n\n\n\n\nUsage examples: \n\n\n\n[@Tanahashi2012]\n\n\nDesign Considerations for Optimizing Storyline Visualizations\n\n\nDynamicDynamic (discrete)Layered graphsN-layers\n\n\n\n\n[@ShixiaLiu2013]\n\n\nStoryFlow: Tracking the Evolution of Stories\n\n\nClusters (pre-existing)DynamicDynamic (discrete)Layered graphsN-layers\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Design Considerations for Optimizing Storyline Visualizations:\n\nFor the time-varying network, we use the Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) network dataset [19].\n\n\nFor example, in the MID network dataset, which consists of 196 nations and 740 time steps, the genome length was reduced from 1714 to 432, allowing the algorithm to gain a considerable speedup.\n\nFrom StoryFlow: Tracking the Evolution of Stories:\n\nWe conducted the experiment based on three movie datasets and a network dataset: Star Wars, Inception, The Matrix, and the MID network dataset (from 1817 to 1947).\n\n\n\n\nFrom Design Considerations for Optimizing Storyline Visualization:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld Maps\n\n\n\n\n\nDatasets contain various attributes for a few locations and their geographical adjacency, namely neighboring states, countries, and municipalities.

The color coding of the category here is directly retrieved from the original KEGG database [43], as similarly incorporated in Metabopolis [64] (see figures in supplementary materials, available online). We also set the same threshold for specifying unimportant vertices as in Metabopolis, so that readers can refer to the paper for comparison (Fig. 6). The advantage of this technique allows us to arrange the vertexts in a balanced fashion by pushing vertexts away from each other. This initially gives users an idea of how big each category is, and explicitly shows which reaction is classified under which category. Users can also identify sub-components effectively since those components with identical topological structures are aligned as neighbors. This also helps users to comprehend which structures are associated with certain types of pathways, such as small chains, stars, etc.\n\n\n\n\nFrom “Multi-Level Area Balancing of Clustered Graphs”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-Phylogenetic Trees\n\n\n\n\n\nCollected by the authors of “https://almob.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13015-014-0031-3.

The probability that two airports are connected by a direct flight is strongly related to their geographical distance: Most direct flights are relatively short, and only few large hub airports are connected by direct long-range flights. The distances in the edge-repulsion LinLog layout resemble the relative geographical distances of the airports remarkably closely, given that the graph does not contain any explicit information about geographical distances.\n\n\nDictionary (Figure 7): The nodes represent terms in the Online Dictionary of Library and Information Science (ODLIS), and the edges represent hyperlinks. A hyperlink between two terms exists if one term is used to describe the meaning of the other term, and thus connects semantically related terms. The edge-repulsion LinLog layout indeed groups semantically related terms, which is better reflected in the VRML file on the supplementary web page than in Figure 7(c). Such a grouping is useful, for example, for discovering the global topic areas (like publishing, printing, information technology, etc.), for identifying entry points for the exploration of topics, or for finding semantically related terms even if they are not explicitly linked.\n\nFrom “A Quality Metric for Visualization of Clusters in Graphs”:\n\nWe re-used some datasets from the validation experiments and created some new ones, listed in Table 2.

The resulting test-bed is made of eight chapters, seven pairs of chapters, six triples of chapters and five quadruples of chapters from “Anna Karenina”, and five chapters, four pairs of chapters and three triples of chapters from “Les Mis ́erables”, plus the entire “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”, “Inception-sf”, “Inception”, “Star Wars”, “The Matrix-sf”, and “The Matrix”.\n\nFrom “Anisotropic Radial Layout for Visualizing Centrality and Structure in Graphs”:\n\nThe third dataset is a graph of character associations in the famous French novel Les Miserables (Fig. 5) [18]. This graph consists of 77 nodes, each representing a character in the novel, and 254 weighted edges where the weights represent the number of chapters that feature both characters associated with an edge. We see the that the main protagonist Valjean (marked in red) is placed prominently in all three visualizations (Fig. 5). However, other key characters in the plot such as Inspector Javert (blue) and Cosett (orange), who do not appear often with characters other than the protagonist (and thus have low betweenness centrality) are treated differently. While the radial layout relegates them to the periphery (far from Valjean) (Fig. 5b), MDS (Fig. 5a) paints a conflicting picture with regard to their centrality, e.g., Cosett’s node almost overlaps with Valjean despite its low centrality. In contrast, the proposed ARL (Fig.5c) is able to coherently convey the low centrality of the Inspector Javert and Cosett, as well as, their closeness to Valjean. The above issue of distance distortion appears to be a frequent occurrence in the radial layout due to many characters who have a low centrality value causing them to end up being packed in the outer periphery. A case of contrast is that of the character Bishop Myriel (green) who despite being associated with several characters, is only seen with Valjean once.\n\n\n\n\nFrom “Crossing Minimization in Storyline Visualizations”:\n\n\n\nFrom “Graph Layouts by t-SNE”:\n\n\n\nlesmis is the GraphBase Les Miserables graph\nFrom “Anisotropic Radial Layout for Visualizing Centrality and Structure in Graphs”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuiteSparse Matrix Collection\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SuiteSparse Matrix Collection, formerly known as the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection, is a comprehensive repository of 2893 sparse matrices.

Namely they cite the Harwell-Boeing collection as the starting point for SuiteSparse, then called the University of Florida (UF) Sparse matrix collection, back in 1991. Other groups, or collections, have then been added to SuitseSparse through the years, mainly focusing on real-world matrices and other relevant problems related to them.\n\nOriginally found at: https://sparse.tamu.edu/\n\n\n\nSize: 2893\n\n\n\nOrigin paper: \n\n\n\n[@davis2011]\n\n\nThe University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection\n\n\n\n\nUsage examples: \n\n\n\n[@Gansner2013]\n\n\nA Maxent-Stress Model for Graph Layout\n\n\nGeneric\n\n\n\n\n[@Ortmann2017]\n\n\nA Sparse Stress Model\n\n\nLargeWeighted edges\n\n\n\n\n[@Eades2018]\n\n\nDrawing Big Graphs Using Spectral Sparsification\n\n\nGenericLarge\n\n\n\n\n[@Hong2019]\n\n\nMulti-level Graph Drawing Using Infomap Clustering\n\n\nMultilevel\n\n\n\n\n[@Brsig2020]\n\n\nStochastic Gradient Descent Works Really Well for Stress Minimization\n\n\nGeneric\n\n\n\n\n[@kruiger2017]\n\n\nGraph Layouts by t-SNE\n\n\nClusters (generated)GenericPlanarSpatial\n\n\n\n\n[@zheng2019]\n\n\nGraph Drawing by Stochastic Gradient Descent\n\n\nGeneric\n\n\n\n\n[@DRGraph21]\n\n\nDRGraph: An Efficient Graph Layout Algorithm for Large-scale Graphs by Dimensionality Reduction\n\n\nGenericLarge\n\n\n\n\n[@zhong2023]\n\n\nForce-Directed Graph Layouts Revisited: A New Force Based on the T-Distribution\n\n\nGeneric\n\n\n\n\n[@miller2023]\n\n\nSpherical Graph Drawing by Multi-dimensional Scaling\n\n\nGeneric\n\n\n\n\n[@meidiana2023]\n\n\nShape-Faithful Graph Drawings\n\n\nMesh\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom “A Sparse Stress Model”:\n\nWe conducted our experiments on a series of different graphs, see Tab. 1, most of them taken from the sparse matrix collection [9].

In addition there is a 3D semi-structured graph, cti, which is unstructured in the x−y plane but extended regularly along the z-axis. Finally the test suite includes three non mesh-based graphs (add32, vibrobox, bcsstk32) which arise from various scientific computing applications2. None of the graphs have either vertex or edge weights; such graphs are not widely available since most applications do not accurately instrument costs and it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from the few examples that we have access to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom “An Experimental Comparison of Fast Algorithms for Drawing General Large Graphs”:\n\n\n\nFrom “Multi-Level Graph Layout on the GPU”:\n\n\n\nFig. 11. 4elt.

Because of geographical closeness and free trade agreements, countries on the same continent trade more intensively than countries on different continents.

The layout of the widely used Fruchterman-Reingold model [20] does not show any clear groups at all.

These collections group together datasets from the same real-life context, which may have multiple sources. Real-life contexts are distinguishable by specific properties or requirements found in graphs from those sources; for instance, collaboration networks can be represented as hypergraphs, while air traffic routes have nodes (airports) with fixed spatial coordinates and numerous edges connecting the nodes, making them suitable for edge bundling algorithms.

Note that in all images here generated with our method, we used simple additive edge blending only, as our focus here is the layout, not the rendering. Images (a,b) show an air traffic graph (nodes are city locations, edges are interconnecting flights)… Images (e-h) show the US migrations graph bundled with the WR, GBEB, FDEB, and our method (SBEB) respectively. Overall, SBEB produces stronger bundling, due to the many iterations I = 10 being used), and emphasizes the structure of connections between groups of close cities (due to the skeleton layout cues). If less bundling is desired, fewer iterations can be used (Fig. 4). Adjusting the postprocessing smoothing and relaxation parameters, SBEB can create bundling styles similar to either GBEB (higher bundle curvatures, more emphasis on the graph structure) or FDEB (smoother bundles). Finally, images (i,j) show the US airlines graph bundled with the FDEB and SBEB respectively. SBEB generates stronger bundling (more overdraw) but arguably less clutter. Note also that SBEB generates treelike bundle structures which is useful when the exploration task at hand has an inherent (local) hierarchical nature, e.g. see how traffic connections merge into and/or split from main traffic routes.\n\n\n\n\nFrom “Edge-Path Bundling: A Less Ambiguous Edge Bundling Approach”:\n\n\n\nFig. 1. Edge bundling of the migrations dataset. (a) Straight line drawing.

(c) Cubu has a similar drawback at the centre of the map to a lesser degree. (d) Winding roads divides this structure into several smaller flows, but they may not be necessarily related to graph structure. (e) Edge-path bundling is able to distinguish between several flows that reflect paths in the underlying graph. (f) When edge direction is considered, the algorithm is able to further subdivide these flows based on direction.\n\n\n\nFig. 8. Airlines (undirected). (a) Input drawing. (b) Force-directed bundling is able to cluster edges into the major flows, but some overaggregation prevents details from being visualised. (c) Cubu provides a good bundling, but also has overaggregation. (c) Confluent drawings can be imposed on the layout, but as the approach cannot layout the graph bicliques can be distantly located, resulting in suboptimal performance. (e) Winding roads divides the flows into many streams, but these streams can be unfaithful to graph structure. (f) Edge-path bundling aggregates edges using weighted paths. The four prominent bundle intersections on the east coast correspond to major airports: Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis, and Dallas.\n\n\n\nFig. 10. Results of four algorithms on the air traffic network. (a) Force-directed bundling is able to recover the major trajectories but does not strongly bundle the network. (b) Cubu strongly bundles the main flows of airtraffic, but can suffer from overaggregation. (c) Winding roads divides the traffic into many smaller bundles, but this may not be reflective of underlying graph structure. (d) With edge-path bundling, each bundle necessarily reflects a path in the network. There are separate flows across the atlantic and asia that correspond to paths through the network.\nFrom “Skeleton-Based Edge Bundling for Graph Visualization”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Dependency Graphs\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious software call dependency graphs have been used in the literature.

This graph contains 34 nodes, each representing an individual, and 78 unweighted edges that represent a friendship between the associated individuals (Fig. 1). During the period of observation, a conflict between two key members, identified as the “administrator” and “instructor”, leads to a split in the club, giving it an interesting two cluster structure. In Fig. 1, nodes representing members who are part of the instructor’s and administrator’s groups are drawn in green and blue, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nFrom “The Turing Test for Graph Drawing Algorithms”:\n\n\n\nFigure from supplementary materials using a force directed layout.\nFrom “Anisotropic Radial Layout for Visualizing Centrality and Structure in Graphs”:\n\n\n\nFig. 1.

The network size varies from 762 to 41K vertices and from 16K to 1.6M edges. Thedataset is directly from Facebook, not sampled, and thus very complete in terms of capturing the social relations according to a widely used service at that time. Additional attributes obtained from the Facebook profiles are gender, expected year of graduation, dormitory, etc. Due to incomplete profiles, a number of attribute values are missing.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Untangling the Hairballs of Multi-Centered, Small-World Online Social Media Networks\nFig. 1. Facebook friendships at California Institute of Technology (Caltech36). Vertex color corresponds to dormitory (gray for missing values), but has not been utilized by the layout algorithm.

A discrete dynamic graph is built using the method of Brandes et al.  [9], with an undirected edge inserted into a timeslice if the participants reciprocally report “best friendship” or “friendship” at that time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom SetCoLa: High-Level Constraints for Graph Layout:\n\nSocial networks can be a powerful way to understand inter-personal relationships and are useful for tracking the spread of diseases that result from personal contact [RST*98, FHH*01, MRV*03, FHD*11]. The ability to track and identify at risk individuals can lead to treatment and help manage the spread of the disease. In addition to the links between individuals, structuring the layout by node properties such as the social or ethnographically-identified group may reveal additional details about how the disease is spread.\n\n\n\n\nFrom SetCoLa: High-Level Constraints for Graph Layout:\n\n\n\nFig. 4. The layout for the syphilis social network from (a) Rothenberg et al. [RST*98]. (b) We recreated and improved the layout in SetCoLa by introducing additional padding, alignment, and circle constraints to further highlight the relative number of interactions among the different groups. For both figures, the nodes are split into three groups, from left to right: young affluent white men, younger white women, and young African-American men. Individuals not associated with any of these “core” groups are positioned above the others. In both figures, individuals diagnosed with syphilis during the outbreak are labeled with an “S” on the node label.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransportation Networks\n\n\n\n\n\nTransportation networks are interesting because of their Spatialnature, and feautre Directed edges DIMACS USA Road Network source notes that the data has errors, namely missing major highways and bridges.

These networks have not been used as examples for previous metro map layout methods, so we can compare only against the official maps of Vienna and London. The size of the metro graphs (including Sydney) is given in Table 3 and ranges from 84 vertices and 8 faces (Vienna) to 308 vertices and 55 faces (London).

A dataset that is not accessible anymore renders all the papers using it unfortunately not reproducible. Most of the instances we found became lost because of lack of maintenance of the original storage locations: websites, servers, or repositories. This is, unfortunately, a significant issue in science, which is now hopefully gaining more attention.\n“Loss” of a dataset does not exclusively mean that the entire, original dataset became lost, but also that a paper using a dataset with particular edits—such as interpreting a debate as a graph between the participants—has not documented well enough their process and did not link to the edited dataset. This makes it impossible to reproduce the results of the paper, and is further discussed in Section 1.1.6.\nWhile we did go through the effort, for each one of them, to recover them and store them on OSF, we could not find anywhere the following list of datasets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGION\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data was originally collected for a Bioinformatics paper, Graph-based clustering and characterization of repetitive sequences in next-generation sequencing data.

To understand whether the experimental results are influenced by the structure of the graph we considered several graph families. All graphs are of small or medium size, expressed as the number of their vertices. In some cases, the size and the number of instances used for each graph family depends on the type of question we want to answer (see Sect. 5 for details). We used the following datasets: Trees. Generated with uniform probability distribution using Pru ̈fer sequences [28]. Planar. Connected simple planar graphs, generated with the OGDF library [6]. General. Connected simple graphs, generated with uniform probability distribution. Scale-free. Scale-free graphs, generated according to the Barabasi-Albert model [2]. Caterpillars. Each caterpillar of n vertices is generated by first creating a path (spine of the caterpillar) of length \\(k\\in [ \\frac{n}{4} , \\frac{n}{2} ]\\) (randomly chosen), and attaching each remaining vertex to a randomly selected vertex of the spine. Paths, Cycles. For each desired number of vertices n, there is only one (unlabeled) path and one (unlabeled) cycle of n vertices. k-ary Trees. Rooted trees where each node has either 0 or k children. Each tree is generated by starting with a single vertex and then creating k children of a randomly selected leaf, until the desired number n of vertices is achieved. When n cannot be obtained, we use a value close to it.\n\nFrom “An Interactive Tool to Explore and Improve the Ply Number of Drawings”:\n\nFM3data contains 50 caterpillars with 250 to 450 vertices… FM3data also contains planar graphs ranging from 250 to 400 vertices and a density ranging from 1.5 to 2… The remaining subset of FM3data consists of general graphs with 250 to 450 vertices and the densities 1.5 and 2.5.\n\n\n\n\nFrom “An Experimental Study on the Ply Number of Straight-Line Drawings”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPadia Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nThese consist of fabricated narratives for characters of popular culture franchises, namely “The Witcher” and “Friends”. They were proposed by Kapesh Padia et al. as case studies for Yarn: Generating Storyline Visualizations Using HTN Planning.

In our example narrative, the hero, Geralt of Rivia needs to rescue his friend, Triss Merigold, who has mysteriously disappeared. On his journey to find her he must first determine where she was seen last, talk to multiple friends, and resolve a conflict between a troll couple before he can meet her. There are two choice points in this narrative: first, Margot can either choose to help Geralt or refuse to provide help; second, the troll couple can either accept or reject Geralt’s solution to their conflict. Each of these choices affects the outcome of the narrative creating three possible timelines. The first timeline contains events favorable to Geralt. In this timeline, Margot agrees to help Geralt and the troll couple accept Geralt’s solution leading him to find Triss. Fig. 5 shows a visualization of this outcome as the reality timeline for our narrative. We can see that Geralt was able to successfully track Triss’s last known location, gather information from friends, resolve a conflict between the trolls, and meet Triss. Note that in this visualization we are showing the default, reality timeline and all links are drawn with 100% opacity. We can also observe all single-entity events in the narrative in this visualization. In the second timeline, the trolls reject Geralt’s solution to their conflict. Fig. 6 shows a visualization of this unfavorable outcome as diegetic timeline overlaid on top of the reality timeline. While most of the events are same in both timelines, the diegetic timeline ends at the event “Speak to She-Troll.” The reduced opacity of the reality timeline allows the user to compare common sections of the two timelines, even when one of them is smaller than the other. In the third timeline, Margot refuses to help Geralt preventing him from progressing further on his quest. This is the shortest timeline in our narrative.\n\nFrom ’’Yarn: Generating Storyline Visualizations Using HTN Planning”:\n\nFor our second example we use a fictional narrative scenario based on the popular sitcom Friends. In this narrative, Ross’s plan is to take Rachel on a date. To do so, he must acquire more information about her, find some way of talking to her, ensure she is positively disposed towards him, and eventually ask her out. He can acquire more information about her in a number of ways including calling her mother, or asking Phoebe about her by either call or text. To ensure she is in a positive mood, he can either give her a gift or say nice things to her, and finally he can either ask her out himself or ask for Phoebe’s help. To illustrate causality of events in the narrative timeline, we have set up the operator functions for Rachel such that she is more inclined to say yes to Ross if he talks to her mother rather than requesting Phoebe’s help. Additionally, Rachel’s probability of accepting Ross’s proposal is also dependent on how impressed she is by him when he asks her. There are four choice points in this narrative: three for Ross, and one for Rachel. The choices made by Ross create 12 alternate timelines, each illustrating a different way in which he can ask Rachel out. Towards the end of each timeline Rachel can decide to either reply yes to Ross, or reply no, creating a total of 24 timelines. Fig. 7 shows a visualization where Rachel agrees to go out with Ross in both timelines. While the timelines result in the same outcome, and visually look the same, we can inspect the labels on top of the events in Ross’s timeline to identify the differences. Lighter labels correspond to the reality timeline, while darker labels correspond to the diegetic timeline. In the reality timeline, Ross decided to give a gift to Rachel after talking to her mom, while in the diegetic timeline he decided to act friendly with her. Fig. 8 shows another visualization for the same narrative. In this example we can see the effect of causal conditions set in the operator functions for Rachel. In the reality timeline, Rachel decided not to go out with Ross because he asked Phoebe for help by messaging her. On the other hand, she agreed to go out with him in the diegetic timeline because in this case Ross decided to talk to her mother.\n\n\n\n\nFrom ’’Yarn: Generating Storyline Visualizations Using HTN Planning”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternet Mapping Project\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original Internet Mapping Project started at Bell lab in 1998.

While this data is not quite a tree (or even connected, or planar), we extract a subset to create a tree with 500 nodes. The maximum node degree of this tree is 5 and the radius is 14.\n\n\n\n\nFrom The Mathematics Genealogy Project:\n\n\n\nFrom “Visualizing Evolving Trees”:\n\n\n\nFig. 4: Layouts from DynNoSlice, DynaGraph, Dagre, Radial, ImPrEd, DynaCola and DynaSafe of the same evolving math genealogy tree; each row adds six new nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the data we collected, we also found several instances of custom-made datasets. We consider custom-made datasets either edits to pre-existing datasets, where the authors found it necessary to either split or modify the dataset in a particular way, or datasets completely made up from scratch using random generators or custom-made code. This can happen in cases where the authors of a paper needed a dataset containing particular characteristics which was not easy to find in the wild, so a new dataset was crafted.\nFor instance, consider the case where the authors of a paper develop an algorithm that works on hypergraphs. They want to test that the algorithm works, and test its performance on hypergraphs of various sizes, but datasets containing hypergraphs are difficult to find. For this reason, the authors craft one dataset synthetically, or take a pre-existing dataset and edit it so that it now contains hyperedges.\nWe split custom-made datasets in three categories, with their occurrences in the corpus of papers illustrated below:\n\n{ \n  let d = []\n  \n  let allbenchmarkdatasets = [...new Set(literature.map(l =&gt; l[\"Dataset tag clean\"].split(\",\").map(d =&gt; d.trim())).flat())].filter(a =&gt; a != \"\")\n\n  for (let dataset of allbenchmarkdatasets){\n    if (!dataset.includes(\"Custom\")) continue;\n    let literature_entries_with_this_dataset = literature.filter(l =&gt; l[\"Dataset tag clean\"].includes(dataset))\n\n    d.push({\"dataset\": dataset, \"count\": literature_entries_with_this_dataset.length})\n  }\n  \n  return Plot.plot({\n    color: {\n      // legend: true,\n      type: \"categorical\",\n      // domain: d3.range(10).map((d, i) =&gt; `Category ${i + 1}`),\n      scheme: \"Tableau10\" // use the \"accent\" scheme\n    },\n    y: {\n      // tickFormat: \"s\"\n    },\n    marks: [\n      Plot.barX(d, {x: \"count\", y: \"dataset\", fill: \"dataset\",inset: 2, sort: {y: \"x\", reverse: true}}),\n      Plot.axisY({label: null, lineWidth: 12, marginLeft: 150}),\n    ]\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The chart shows what type of edits were made to datasets, or how they were generated. Non-Replicable edits or generation of datasets where the majority in the corpus of papers we collected.\n\n\n\n\nReplicable datasets indicate cases where the authors have given enough information so that the experiment can be replicated exactly as it was run by the authors of a paper, or closely enough that the results obtained reflect the published ones very closely. This includes cases where either the authors published the entire dataset they used, they published the code they used to generate the dataset, or include an exact description of the steps they took to generate it.\nReproducible datasets are cases where the authors described the steps they took to generate and/or edit their datasets, but not in-depth enough so that the exact same graphs can be reproduced, and did not redistribute it. Results can still be reproduces somewhat closely if the authors took care to report enough information about their graphs.\nFor non-replicable datasets, we indicate cases where the authors did not distribute their datasets and did not include enough information in the paper so that their results could be replicated.\nThis information is closely tied to the distribution of supplemental material in papers, that is shown in the chart below:\n\n{ \n  let d = []\n  \n  let allbenchmarkdatasets = [...new Set(literature.map(l =&gt; l[\"Supplemental material (Multi-select)\"].split(\",\").map(d =&gt; d.trim())).flat())].filter(a =&gt; a != \"\")\n\n  for (let dataset of allbenchmarkdatasets){\n    let literature_entries_with_this_dataset = literature.filter(l =&gt; l[\"Supplemental material (Multi-select)\"].includes(dataset))\n\n    if (dataset == \"Yes\") continue;\n    // capitalize first letter\n    dataset = dataset.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + dataset.slice(1)\n\n    d.push({\"dataset\": dataset, \"count\": literature_entries_with_this_dataset.length})\n  }\n  \n  return Plot.plot({\n    color: {\n      // legend: true,\n      type: \"categorical\",\n      // domain: d3.range(10).map((d, i) =&gt; `Category ${i + 1}`),\n      scheme: \"Tableau10\" // use the \"accent\" scheme\n    },\n    y: {\n      // tickFormat: \"s\"\n    },\n    marks: [\n      Plot.barX(d, {x: \"count\", y: \"dataset\", fill: \"dataset\",inset: 2, sort: {y: \"x\", reverse: true}}),\n      Plot.axisY({label: null, lineWidth: 12, marginLeft: 150}),\n    ]\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: What is distributed as supplemental material with papers? Most papers just distribute an extended version of their content, while another large chunk in our analysis did not distribute any.\n\n\n\n\nThis discussion is part of a larger discourse on research replicability, that is gaining traction in the scientific community. The ACM, for instance, has a policy on artifact review and badging, where authors are encouraged to submit their artifacts for review, and if they pass, they receive a badge that indicates the artifact is available for review. This is a step towards making research more replicable and reproducible, and we hope that our work will contribute to this effort.\nSee, e.g., ACM’s definitions at https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current."

    "text": "The datasets we collected are divided in different categories: the categorization we used is the same as the one used in @dibartolomeo2024evaluating. The following is a brief explanation of the categories used, which are explained in deeper detail in each one of the corresponding chapters.\n\nUniform Benchmark (Section 1.1.1): Datasets that are standalone widely used collections of graphs featuring uniform characteristics - usually simple, generic graphs, often used in evaluations that run over thousands of graphs to report average completion times, or other experiments where the reported metrics are usually aggregated.\nEstablished Network Repository (Section 1.1.2): A collection of individual, or groups of graphs, part of a larger repository. These datasets are often used in evaluations that require a diverse set of graphs, or when the evaluation is focused on a specific type of graph. These collections usually also report on graphs with their own statistics or visualizations, providing a summary of the dataset. This category also includes Subsets (Section 1.1.2.10).\nSingle Graphs (Section 1.1.3): The data used is comprised of one individual graph, which often contains special characteristics making it particularly relevant for the evaluation at hand.\nAggregate Collections (Section 1.1.4): Collections of graphs focusing on one specific context (such as forum posts, or airline routes) due to the given context having a special set of features that is relevant for a graph layout algorithm.\n\nThe type of collection informs various aspects of an evaluation, such as which results are relevant to report. For this discussion, we refer to @dibartolomeo2024evaluating, where the authors link the type of collection in the context of graph layout evaluations.\nThe following visualization shows the amount of datasets we collected per category:\n\n{ \n  let d = []\n  \n  let collection_type = benchmark_datasets.map(a =&gt; a[\"Type of Collection\"]);\n\n  for (let c of [... new Set(collection_type)]){\n    if (c == \"Skip\" || c == \"Missed it\") continue;\n    let count = collection_type.filter(a =&gt; a == c).length;\n    if (c.includes(\"No report\")) c = \"Established Network Repository\";\n    if (c.includes(\"Lost\")) continue;\n    d.push({\"collection_type\": c, \"count\": count})\n  }\n  \n  return Plot.plot({\n    color: {\n      scheme: \"Tableau10\" \n    },\n    marks: [\n      Plot.barX(d, {x: \"count\", y: \"collection_type\", fill: \"collection_type\", inset: 2, sort: {y: \"x\", reverse: true}}),\n      Plot.axisY({label: null, lineWidth: 12, marginLeft: 150}),\n    ]\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Occurrences of datasets we collected per category. Unform benchmark datasets were the majority.\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, some of the datasets used in layout algorithm evaluations are not accessible anymore. Where possible, we still collected and reported all the information contained in the papers about the datasets, so that we can conserve an idea of what they contained. This phenomenon, as well as the information we could collect, is discussed in Lost and Unavailable Datasets (Section 1.1.5).\n\n{ \n  let d = []\n  \n  let collection_type = benchmark_datasets.map(a =&gt; a[\"Type of Collection\"]);\n\n  for (let c of [... new Set(collection_type)]){\n    if (c == \"Skip\" || c == \"Missed it\") continue;\n    let count = collection_type.filter(a =&gt; a == c).length;\n    if (c.includes(\"No report\")) c = \"Established Network Repository\";\n    if (!c.includes(\"Lost\")) continue;\n    d.push({\"collection_type\": c, \"count\": count})\n  }\n  \n  return Plot.plot({\n    color: {\n      scheme: \"PiYg\" \n    },\n    x: {\n      domain: [0, 15]\n    },\n    marks: [\n      Plot.barX(d, {x: \"count\", y: \"collection_type\", fill: \"collection_type\", inset: 2, sort: {y: \"x\", reverse: true}}),\n      Plot.axisY({label: null, lineWidth: 12, marginLeft: 150}),\n    ]\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Unfortunately, 9 of the datasets we found being used in the literature were either lost or no longer accessible.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we include a discussion on Custom-made Datasets (Section 1.1.6), synthetically generated datasets for the purpose of an experiment.\nEach dataset also contains a number of graph features specific to the graphs contained in it. Authors might want to use a dataset that contains a specific feature, such as a graph with a high number of nodes, or a graph with a specific structure. The following interactive filtering systems allows for filtering of datasets (and papers) based on the features they contain.\n\n\n\n\n\nType to search for datasets by name or feature.

The left column contains all the properties used to tag graphs in the datasets (additional information about the nature of these tags can be found in ?@sec-collection-process and ?@sec-data-processing). Each tag has an associated checkbox: selecting a tag (or more than one) will filter the datasets and papers to only show those that contain the selected tags. The middle column contains the datasets, and the right column contains the papers. Clicking on a dataset or paper will scroll the page to the corresponding section in the paper. The datasets and papers are sorted alphabetically by name and citation name, respectively. The tags, datasets, and papers are generated from the data in the repository, and are updated automatically when the data changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\nDatsets\n\n\nPapers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirlines, Migrations, and Air Traffic\n\n\nAmazon\n\n\nAssorted Collaboration Network\n\n\nAssorted Fiscal

synthetic, or randomly generated graphs. These benchmarks are often used in large-scale evaluations where experiments are run on thousands of graphs, and results are reported as aggregated metrics such as average running time or layout quality scores.\nWhat distinguishes these benchmarks is that they are designed to test the general performance of layout algorithms across a wide range of input sizes and densities, rather than being tied to a particular real-world context or graph semantics. This is different from other collections presented later in this section, which may focus on graphs with specific structural patterns (e.g., social networks, hierarchical trees, storyline structures) or graphs drawn from a single domain.\nThe first of these collapsible sections is shown already expanded, to give an example of the content that can be found in each of them. The content is generated dynamically based on the data we collected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRome-Lib\n\n\n\n\n\nRome-Lib is, as previously discussed, the most common benchmark dataset, due to its already established popularity, its ease of use and access, and the many properties that are already known about it. It was first introduced in [@DiBattista1997b] and presented in their paper ”An experimental comparison of four graph drawing algorithms”.

The set contains 11 389 graphs that consist of 10 to 100 nodes and 9 to 158 edges. These graphs were generated from a core set of 112 “real life” graphs used in database design and software engineering applications. Most of the graphs are sparse, which is a common property in most application areas of automatic graph drawing. The average ratio between the number of edges and the number of nodes of the graphs from the benchmark set is about 1.35.\n\nFrom “Layer-free upward crossing minimization”:\n\nThe Rome graphs [Di Battista et al. 1997] are a widely used benchmark set in graph drawing, obtained from a basic set of 112 real-world graphs. It contains 11,528 instances with 10 through 100 nodes and 9 through 158 edges. Although the graphs are originally undirected, they have been used as directed graphs—by artificially directing the edges according to the node order given in the input files—for showing the performance of the mixed-upward planarization approach [Eiglsperger et al. 2003]. In this case, all edges are directed and the graphs are acyclic; hence, the mixed-upward planarization approach turns into an upward planarization method.\n\nFrom “A New Approach to Exact Crossing Minimization”:\n\nWe say graphs are trivial, if they are planar or if the heuristic achieves a planarization with only one crossing, as in these cases we need not prove optimality. The Rome library contains 7172 non-trivial graphs.\n\nFrom “An Experimental Comparison of Four Graph Drawing Algorithms”\n\nOur test graph generation strategy is as follows. First, we have focused on the important application area of database and software visualization, where Entity-Relationship diagrams and Data-Flow diagrams are usually displayed with orthogonal drawings. Second, we have collected 112 “real life” graphs with number of vertices between 10 and 100, from now on called core graphs, from the following sources:\n\n\n• 54% of the graphs have been obtained from major Italian software companies (especially from Database Informatica) and large government organization (including the Italian Internal Revenue Service and the Italian National Advisory Council for Computer Applications in the Government (Autorita’ per l’Informatica nella Pubblica Amministrazione)); • 33% of the graphs were taken from well-known reference books in software engineering [18] and database design [1], and from journal articles on software visualization in the recent issues of Information Systems and the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering; • 13% of the graphs were extracted from theses in software and database visualization written by students at the University of Rome “La Sapienza”.\n\n\nOur approach is based on the following scheme. We defined several primitive operations for updating graphs, which correspond to the typical operations performed by designers of Entity-Relationship and Data-Flow Diagrams, and attributed a certain probability to each of them. More specifically, the updating primitives we have used are the following: InsertEdge, which inserts a new edge between two existing vertices; DeleteEdge, which deletes an existing edge; InsertVertex, which splits an existing edge into two edges by inserting a new vertex; DeleteVertex, which deletes a vertex and all its incident edges; and MakeVertex, which creates a new vertex and connects it to a subset of vertices. The test graphs were then generated in several iterations starting from the core graphs by applying random sequences of operations with a “genetic” mechanism. Namely, at each iteration a new set of test graphs was obtained by applying a random sequence of operations to the current test set. Each new graph was then evaluated for “suitability”, and those found not suitable were discarded. The probability of each primitive operation was varied at the end of each iteration. The evaluation of the suitability of the generated graphs was conducted using both objective and subjective analyses. The objective analysis consisted of determining whether the new graph had similar structural properties with respect to the core graph it was derived from. We have taken into account parameters like the average ratio between number of vertices and number of edges and the average number of biconnected components. The subjective analysis consisted in a visual inspection of the new graph and an assessment by expert users of Entity-Relationship and Data-Flow diagrams of its similarity to a “real-life” diagram. For obvious reasons, the subjective analysis has been done on a randomly selected subset of the graphs.\n\n\n\n\nFrom ”An Experimental Comparison of Four Graph Drawing Algorithms”:\n\n\n\nFrom “Experimental Analysis of the Accessibility of Drawings with Few Segments”:\n\n\n\nFrom: Deep Neural Network for DrawiNg Networks, (DNN)2:\n\n\n\nFig 5.

We considered two typical contexts where DAGs play a fundamental role, namely software engineering and project planning.\n\n\nThe first set of test DAGs are what we call the North DAGs. They are obtained from a collection of directed graphs [28], that North collected at AT&T Bell Labs by running for two years Draw DAG, an e-mail graph drawing service that accepts directed graphs formatted as e-mail messages and returns messages with the corresponding drawings [27].\n\n\nOriginally, the North DAGs consisted of 5114 directed graphs, whose number of vertices varied in the range 1 … 7602. However, the density of the directed graphs with a number of vertices that did not fall in the range 10 … 100 was very low (see also the statistics in [28]); since such directed graphs represent a very sparse statistical population we decided to discard them. Then we noted that many directed graphs were isomorphic; since the vertices of the directed graphs have labels associated with them, the problem is tractable. For each isomorphism class, we kept only one representative directed graph. Also, we deleted the directed graphs where subgraphs were specified as clusters, to be drawn in their own distinct rectangular region of the layout, because constrained algorithms are beyond the scope of this study. This filtering left us with 1277 directed graphs.\n\n\nStill, 491 directed graphs were not connected and this was a problem for running algorithms implemented in G D W (they assume input directed graphs to be connected). Instead of discarding the directed graphs, we followed a more practical approach, by randomly adding a minimum set of directed edges that makes each directed graph connected. Finally, we made the directed graph acyclic, where necessary, by applying some heuristics for inverting the direction of a small subset of edges.\n\n\nWe then ran a first set of experiments and produced the statistics by grouping the DAGs by number of vertices. Although the comparison among the algorithms looked consistent (the produced plots never oddly overlapped), each single plot was not satisfactory, because it showed peaks and valleys. We went back to study the test suite and observed that grouping them by number of vertices was not the best approach. In fact, the North DAGs come from very heterogeneous sources, mainly representing different phases of various software engineering projects; as a result, directed graphs with more or less the same number of vertices may be either very dense or very sparse.\n\n\nSince most of the analyzed quality measures strongly depend on the number of edges of the DAG (e.g. area, number of bends, and number of crossings), we decided that a better approach was to group the DAGs by number of edges. After some tests, we clustered the DAGs into nine groups, each with at least 40 DAGs, so that the number of edges in the DAGs belonging to group i, 1 ≤ i ≤ 9, is in the range 10 i … 10 i+9 (see Fig. 3). The resulting test suite consists of 1158 DAGs, each with edges in the range 10 … 99.\n\nFrom “Layer-Free Upward Crossing Minimization”:\n\nNorth DAGs. The North DAGs have been introduced in an experimental comparison of algorithms for drawing DAGs [Di Battista et al. 2000]. The benchmark set contains 1,158 DAGs collected by Stephen North, which were slightly modified by Di Battista et al. The graphs are grouped into nine sets, where set i contains graphs with 10 i to 10 i+9 arcs for i=1, …, 9.\n\n\n\n\nFrom “Drawing Directed Acyclic Graphs: An Experimental Study”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom “A Natural Quadratic Approach to the Generalized Graph Layering Problem”:\n\n\n\nFrom “A Flow Formulation for Horizontal Coordinate Assignment with Prescribed Width”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth DAGs\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the same collection as AT&T, but referred to as North DAGs in the papers we analyzed.

The instances contain graphs with \\(3 \\leq i \\leq 7\\) and \\(j \\geq i\\) such that \\(ij \\leq 250\\). \\(G_i \\times P_j\\): The Cartesian product of the path on \\(j+1\\) vertices with one of the 21 non-isomorphic connected graphs on 5 vertices, where \\(i\\) denotes which of the 21.

We compare the nine combinations of schemes to see how close to the conjectured value each of them is able to get, for various sizes of complete graphs up to \\(n = 50\\). We indicate how many crossings are obtained after the initial embedding, as well as at the conclusion of the heuristic. We also provide the runtimes, again separated into time spent producing the initial embedding, and time spent in the main loop of the heuristic.\n\n\nComplete bipartite graphs - Much like the complete graphs, the crossing number of the complete bipartite graph \\(K_{n1,n2}\\) is only known in general for \\(n_1 ≤ 6\\), but the value is conjectured and typically assumed to be correct. Again, we compare the nine combinations of schemes to see how close to the conjectured value they can get for values up to \\(n_1,n_2 = 40\\), and report the same data as for the Complete graphs.\n\n\nThe crossing number of the complete graph \\(K_n\\) is conjectured (e.g. see Guy [25]) to be equal to \\(H(n) := 1/4 \\left\\lfloor n/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor (n − 1)/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor(n − 2)/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor (n − 3)/2\\right\\rfloor\\). Although this conjecture is widely believed to be correct, it has only been confirmed for \\(n ≤ 12\\) despite considerable effort to extend the results further [30]. We ran the graphs \\(K_n\\) for \\(5 ≤ n ≤ 50\\). Each graph was run with 100 random permutations and the minimum found solution was compared to \\(H(n)\\) by computing the percent relative deviation from \\(H(n)\\)… For these graphs, we observe that when \\(n\\) was odd, every scheme combination was able to obtain a drawing with \\(H(n)\\) crossings. However, when \\(n\\) was even, each scheme reached a value which was usually very close but not equal to \\(H(n)\\).\n\n\nThe crossing number of the complete bipartite graph \\(K_{n_1,n_2}\\) is conjectured (e.g. see Zarankiewicz [35]) to be equal to \\(Z(n_1, n_2) := \\left\\lfloor n_1/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor (n_1 − 1)/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor n_2/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor (n_2 − 1)/2\\right\\rfloor\\).

This caused the dataset to be lost for a period of time, as none of the papers that used it provided a link to the dataset or stored it as part of their supplemental material.

These interactions between characters can be separated into a series of interaction sessions, each session representing the time span of a set of interacting characters. More precisely, we define an interaction session as a unit which holds three attributes: • initiation time, • duration, and • members. Initiation time corresponds to the time when the interaction session begins. Duration corresponds to the duration of the interaction session. Members corresponds to the set of characters involved in the interaction session. Each interaction session represents a time slot in the data where its members are interacting. Note that any change in the formation of members (e.g., a character leaving or joining) indicates a separate interaction session.\n\n\n\n\nFrom “An Efficient Framework for Generating Storyline Visualizations from Streaming Data”:\n\n\n\nFrom “StoryFlow: Tracking the Evolution of Stories”:\n\n\n\nFrom “Crossing Minimization in Storyline Visualizations”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilitarized Interstate Disputes (MID)\n\n\n\n\n\nCollected as part of the Correlates Of War project, the dataset contains two disconnected Temporal event sequences\n\nOriginally found at: https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/MIDs/\n\n\n\nDownload formatted data:  GEXF GML GRAPHML JSON\n\n\n\nSize: The dataset consists of 2 disconnected temporal event sequence graphs, one with 11,766 nodes and 5,883 edges, and the other with 9,619 nodes and 8,017 edges.\n\n\n\nOrigin paper: \n\n\n\n[@palmer2022]\n\n\nThe MID5 Dataset, 2011–2014: Procedures, coding rules, and description.\n\n\n\n\nUsage examples: \n\n\n\n[@Tanahashi2012]\n\n\nDesign Considerations for Optimizing Storyline Visualizations\n\n\nDynamicDynamic (discrete)Layered graphsN-layers\n\n\n\n\n[@ShixiaLiu2013]\n\n\nStoryFlow: Tracking the Evolution of Stories\n\n\nClusters (pre-existing)DynamicDynamic (discrete)Layered graphsN-layers\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Design Considerations for Optimizing Storyline Visualizations:\n\nFor the time-varying network, we use the Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) network dataset [19].\n\n\nFor example, in the MID network dataset, which consists of 196 nations and 740 time steps, the genome length was reduced from 1714 to 432, allowing the algorithm to gain a considerable speedup.\n\nFrom StoryFlow: Tracking the Evolution of Stories:\n\nWe conducted the experiment based on three movie datasets and a network dataset: Star Wars, Inception, The Matrix, and the MID network dataset (from 1817 to 1947).\n\n\n\n\nFrom Design Considerations for Optimizing Storyline Visualization:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld Maps\n\n\n\n\n\nDatasets contain various attributes for a few locations and their geographical adjacency, namely neighboring states, countries, and municipalities.

The color coding of the category here is directly retrieved from the original KEGG database [43], as similarly incorporated in Metabopolis [64] (see figures in supplementary materials, available online). We also set the same threshold for specifying unimportant vertices as in Metabopolis, so that readers can refer to the paper for comparison (Fig. 6). The advantage of this technique allows us to arrange the vertexts in a balanced fashion by pushing vertexts away from each other. This initially gives users an idea of how big each category is, and explicitly shows which reaction is classified under which category. Users can also identify sub-components effectively since those components with identical topological structures are aligned as neighbors. This also helps users to comprehend which structures are associated with certain types of pathways, such as small chains, stars, etc.\n\n\n\n\nFrom “Multi-Level Area Balancing of Clustered Graphs”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-Phylogenetic Trees\n\n\n\n\n\nCollected by the authors of “https://almob.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13015-014-0031-3.

The probability that two airports are connected by a direct flight is strongly related to their geographical distance: Most direct flights are relatively short, and only few large hub airports are connected by direct long-range flights. The distances in the edge-repulsion LinLog layout resemble the relative geographical distances of the airports remarkably closely, given that the graph does not contain any explicit information about geographical distances.\n\n\nDictionary (Figure 7): The nodes represent terms in the Online Dictionary of Library and Information Science (ODLIS), and the edges represent hyperlinks. A hyperlink between two terms exists if one term is used to describe the meaning of the other term, and thus connects semantically related terms. The edge-repulsion LinLog layout indeed groups semantically related terms, which is better reflected in the VRML file on the supplementary web page than in Figure 7(c). Such a grouping is useful, for example, for discovering the global topic areas (like publishing, printing, information technology, etc.), for identifying entry points for the exploration of topics, or for finding semantically related terms even if they are not explicitly linked.\n\nFrom “A Quality Metric for Visualization of Clusters in Graphs”:\n\nWe re-used some datasets from the validation experiments and created some new ones, listed in Table 2.

The resulting test-bed is made of eight chapters, seven pairs of chapters, six triples of chapters and five quadruples of chapters from “Anna Karenina”, and five chapters, four pairs of chapters and three triples of chapters from “Les Mis ́erables”, plus the entire “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”, “Inception-sf”, “Inception”, “Star Wars”, “The Matrix-sf”, and “The Matrix”.\n\nFrom “Anisotropic Radial Layout for Visualizing Centrality and Structure in Graphs”:\n\nThe third dataset is a graph of character associations in the famous French novel Les Miserables (Fig. 5) [18]. This graph consists of 77 nodes, each representing a character in the novel, and 254 weighted edges where the weights represent the number of chapters that feature both characters associated with an edge. We see the that the main protagonist Valjean (marked in red) is placed prominently in all three visualizations (Fig. 5). However, other key characters in the plot such as Inspector Javert (blue) and Cosett (orange), who do not appear often with characters other than the protagonist (and thus have low betweenness centrality) are treated differently. While the radial layout relegates them to the periphery (far from Valjean) (Fig. 5b), MDS (Fig. 5a) paints a conflicting picture with regard to their centrality, e.g., Cosett’s node almost overlaps with Valjean despite its low centrality. In contrast, the proposed ARL (Fig.5c) is able to coherently convey the low centrality of the Inspector Javert and Cosett, as well as, their closeness to Valjean. The above issue of distance distortion appears to be a frequent occurrence in the radial layout due to many characters who have a low centrality value causing them to end up being packed in the outer periphery. A case of contrast is that of the character Bishop Myriel (green) who despite being associated with several characters, is only seen with Valjean once.\n\n\n\n\nFrom “Crossing Minimization in Storyline Visualizations”:\n\n\n\nFrom “Graph Layouts by t-SNE”:\n\n\n\nlesmis is the GraphBase Les Miserables graph\nFrom “Anisotropic Radial Layout for Visualizing Centrality and Structure in Graphs”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuiteSparse Matrix Collection\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SuiteSparse Matrix Collection, formerly known as the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection, is a comprehensive repository of 2893 sparse matrices.

Namely they cite the Harwell-Boeing collection as the starting point for SuiteSparse, then called the University of Florida (UF) Sparse matrix collection, back in 1991. Other groups, or collections, have then been added to SuitseSparse through the years, mainly focusing on real-world matrices and other relevant problems related to them.\n\nOriginally found at: https://sparse.tamu.edu/\n\n\n\nSize: 2893\n\n\n\nOrigin paper: \n\n\n\n[@davis2011]\n\n\nThe University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection\n\n\n\n\nUsage examples: \n\n\n\n[@Gansner2013]\n\n\nA Maxent-Stress Model for Graph Layout\n\n\nGeneric\n\n\n\n\n[@Ortmann2017]\n\n\nA Sparse Stress Model\n\n\nLargeWeighted edges\n\n\n\n\n[@Eades2018]\n\n\nDrawing Big Graphs Using Spectral Sparsification\n\n\nGenericLarge\n\n\n\n\n[@Hong2019]\n\n\nMulti-level Graph Drawing Using Infomap Clustering\n\n\nMultilevel\n\n\n\n\n[@Brsig2020]\n\n\nStochastic Gradient Descent Works Really Well for Stress Minimization\n\n\nGeneric\n\n\n\n\n[@kruiger2017]\n\n\nGraph Layouts by t-SNE\n\n\nClusters (generated)GenericPlanarSpatial\n\n\n\n\n[@zheng2019]\n\n\nGraph Drawing by Stochastic Gradient Descent\n\n\nGeneric\n\n\n\n\n[@DRGraph21]\n\n\nDRGraph: An Efficient Graph Layout Algorithm for Large-scale Graphs by Dimensionality Reduction\n\n\nGenericLarge\n\n\n\n\n[@zhong2023]\n\n\nForce-Directed Graph Layouts Revisited: A New Force Based on the T-Distribution\n\n\nGeneric\n\n\n\n\n[@miller2023]\n\n\nSpherical Graph Drawing by Multi-dimensional Scaling\n\n\nGeneric\n\n\n\n\n[@meidiana2023]\n\n\nShape-Faithful Graph Drawings\n\n\nMesh\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom “A Sparse Stress Model”:\n\nWe conducted our experiments on a series of different graphs, see Tab. 1, most of them taken from the sparse matrix collection [9].

In addition there is a 3D semi-structured graph, cti, which is unstructured in the x−y plane but extended regularly along the z-axis. Finally the test suite includes three non mesh-based graphs (add32, vibrobox, bcsstk32) which arise from various scientific computing applications2. None of the graphs have either vertex or edge weights; such graphs are not widely available since most applications do not accurately instrument costs and it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from the few examples that we have access to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom “An Experimental Comparison of Fast Algorithms for Drawing General Large Graphs”:\n\n\n\nFrom “Multi-Level Graph Layout on the GPU”:\n\n\n\nFig. 11. 4elt.

Because of geographical closeness and free trade agreements, countries on the same continent trade more intensively than countries on different continents.

The layout of the widely used Fruchterman-Reingold model [20] does not show any clear groups at all.

These collections group together datasets from the same real-life context, which may have multiple sources. Real-life contexts are distinguishable by specific properties or requirements found in graphs from those sources; for instance, collaboration networks can be represented as hypergraphs, while air traffic routes have nodes (airports) with fixed spatial coordinates and numerous edges connecting the nodes, making them suitable for edge bundling algorithms.

Note that in all images here generated with our method, we used simple additive edge blending only, as our focus here is the layout, not the rendering. Images (a,b) show an air traffic graph (nodes are city locations, edges are interconnecting flights)… Images (e-h) show the US migrations graph bundled with the WR, GBEB, FDEB, and our method (SBEB) respectively. Overall, SBEB produces stronger bundling, due to the many iterations I = 10 being used), and emphasizes the structure of connections between groups of close cities (due to the skeleton layout cues). If less bundling is desired, fewer iterations can be used (Fig. 4). Adjusting the postprocessing smoothing and relaxation parameters, SBEB can create bundling styles similar to either GBEB (higher bundle curvatures, more emphasis on the graph structure) or FDEB (smoother bundles). Finally, images (i,j) show the US airlines graph bundled with the FDEB and SBEB respectively. SBEB generates stronger bundling (more overdraw) but arguably less clutter. Note also that SBEB generates treelike bundle structures which is useful when the exploration task at hand has an inherent (local) hierarchical nature, e.g. see how traffic connections merge into and/or split from main traffic routes.\n\n\n\n\nFrom “Edge-Path Bundling: A Less Ambiguous Edge Bundling Approach”:\n\n\n\nFig. 1. Edge bundling of the migrations dataset. (a) Straight line drawing.

(c) Cubu has a similar drawback at the centre of the map to a lesser degree. (d) Winding roads divides this structure into several smaller flows, but they may not be necessarily related to graph structure. (e) Edge-path bundling is able to distinguish between several flows that reflect paths in the underlying graph. (f) When edge direction is considered, the algorithm is able to further subdivide these flows based on direction.\n\n\n\nFig. 8. Airlines (undirected). (a) Input drawing. (b) Force-directed bundling is able to cluster edges into the major flows, but some overaggregation prevents details from being visualised. (c) Cubu provides a good bundling, but also has overaggregation. (c) Confluent drawings can be imposed on the layout, but as the approach cannot layout the graph bicliques can be distantly located, resulting in suboptimal performance. (e) Winding roads divides the flows into many streams, but these streams can be unfaithful to graph structure. (f) Edge-path bundling aggregates edges using weighted paths. The four prominent bundle intersections on the east coast correspond to major airports: Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis, and Dallas.\n\n\n\nFig. 10. Results of four algorithms on the air traffic network. (a) Force-directed bundling is able to recover the major trajectories but does not strongly bundle the network. (b) Cubu strongly bundles the main flows of airtraffic, but can suffer from overaggregation. (c) Winding roads divides the traffic into many smaller bundles, but this may not be reflective of underlying graph structure. (d) With edge-path bundling, each bundle necessarily reflects a path in the network. There are separate flows across the atlantic and asia that correspond to paths through the network.\nFrom “Skeleton-Based Edge Bundling for Graph Visualization”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Dependency Graphs\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious software call dependency graphs have been used in the literature.

This graph contains 34 nodes, each representing an individual, and 78 unweighted edges that represent a friendship between the associated individuals (Fig. 1). During the period of observation, a conflict between two key members, identified as the “administrator” and “instructor”, leads to a split in the club, giving it an interesting two cluster structure. In Fig. 1, nodes representing members who are part of the instructor’s and administrator’s groups are drawn in green and blue, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nFrom “The Turing Test for Graph Drawing Algorithms”:\n\n\n\nFigure from supplementary materials using a force directed layout.\nFrom “Anisotropic Radial Layout for Visualizing Centrality and Structure in Graphs”:\n\n\n\nFig. 1.

The network size varies from 762 to 41K vertices and from 16K to 1.6M edges. Thedataset is directly from Facebook, not sampled, and thus very complete in terms of capturing the social relations according to a widely used service at that time. Additional attributes obtained from the Facebook profiles are gender, expected year of graduation, dormitory, etc. Due to incomplete profiles, a number of attribute values are missing.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Untangling the Hairballs of Multi-Centered, Small-World Online Social Media Networks\nFig. 1. Facebook friendships at California Institute of Technology (Caltech36). Vertex color corresponds to dormitory (gray for missing values), but has not been utilized by the layout algorithm.

A discrete dynamic graph is built using the method of Brandes et al.  [9], with an undirected edge inserted into a timeslice if the participants reciprocally report “best friendship” or “friendship” at that time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom SetCoLa: High-Level Constraints for Graph Layout:\n\nSocial networks can be a powerful way to understand inter-personal relationships and are useful for tracking the spread of diseases that result from personal contact [RST*98, FHH*01, MRV*03, FHD*11]. The ability to track and identify at risk individuals can lead to treatment and help manage the spread of the disease. In addition to the links between individuals, structuring the layout by node properties such as the social or ethnographically-identified group may reveal additional details about how the disease is spread.\n\n\n\n\nFrom SetCoLa: High-Level Constraints for Graph Layout:\n\n\n\nFig. 4. The layout for the syphilis social network from (a) Rothenberg et al. [RST*98]. (b) We recreated and improved the layout in SetCoLa by introducing additional padding, alignment, and circle constraints to further highlight the relative number of interactions among the different groups. For both figures, the nodes are split into three groups, from left to right: young affluent white men, younger white women, and young African-American men. Individuals not associated with any of these “core” groups are positioned above the others. In both figures, individuals diagnosed with syphilis during the outbreak are labeled with an “S” on the node label.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransportation Networks\n\n\n\n\n\nTransportation networks are interesting because of their Spatialnature, and feautre Directed edges DIMACS USA Road Network source notes that the data has errors, namely missing major highways and bridges.

These networks have not been used as examples for previous metro map layout methods, so we can compare only against the official maps of Vienna and London. The size of the metro graphs (including Sydney) is given in Table 3 and ranges from 84 vertices and 8 faces (Vienna) to 308 vertices and 55 faces (London).

A dataset that is not accessible anymore renders all the papers using it unfortunately not reproducible. Most of the instances we found became lost because of lack of maintenance of the original storage locations: websites, servers, or repositories. This is, unfortunately, a significant issue in science, which is now hopefully gaining more attention.\n“Loss” of a dataset does not exclusively mean that the entire, original dataset became lost, but also that a paper using a dataset with particular edits—such as interpreting a debate as a graph between the participants—has not documented well enough their process and did not link to the edited dataset. This makes it impossible to reproduce the results of the paper, and is further discussed in Section 1.1.6.\nWhile we did go through the effort, for each one of them, to recover them and store them on OSF, we could not find anywhere the following list of datasets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGION\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data was originally collected for a Bioinformatics paper, Graph-based clustering and characterization of repetitive sequences in next-generation sequencing data.

To understand whether the experimental results are influenced by the structure of the graph we considered several graph families. All graphs are of small or medium size, expressed as the number of their vertices. In some cases, the size and the number of instances used for each graph family depends on the type of question we want to answer (see Sect. 5 for details). We used the following datasets: Trees. Generated with uniform probability distribution using Pru ̈fer sequences [28]. Planar. Connected simple planar graphs, generated with the OGDF library [6]. General. Connected simple graphs, generated with uniform probability distribution. Scale-free. Scale-free graphs, generated according to the Barabasi-Albert model [2]. Caterpillars. Each caterpillar of n vertices is generated by first creating a path (spine of the caterpillar) of length \\(k\\in [ \\frac{n}{4} , \\frac{n}{2} ]\\) (randomly chosen), and attaching each remaining vertex to a randomly selected vertex of the spine. Paths, Cycles. For each desired number of vertices n, there is only one (unlabeled) path and one (unlabeled) cycle of n vertices. k-ary Trees. Rooted trees where each node has either 0 or k children. Each tree is generated by starting with a single vertex and then creating k children of a randomly selected leaf, until the desired number n of vertices is achieved. When n cannot be obtained, we use a value close to it.\n\nFrom “An Interactive Tool to Explore and Improve the Ply Number of Drawings”:\n\nFM3data contains 50 caterpillars with 250 to 450 vertices… FM3data also contains planar graphs ranging from 250 to 400 vertices and a density ranging from 1.5 to 2… The remaining subset of FM3data consists of general graphs with 250 to 450 vertices and the densities 1.5 and 2.5.\n\n\n\n\nFrom “An Experimental Study on the Ply Number of Straight-Line Drawings”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPadia Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nThese consist of fabricated narratives for characters of popular culture franchises, namely “The Witcher” and “Friends”.

In our example narrative, the hero, Geralt of Rivia needs to rescue his friend, Triss Merigold, who has mysteriously disappeared. On his journey to find her he must first determine where she was seen last, talk to multiple friends, and resolve a conflict between a troll couple before he can meet her. There are two choice points in this narrative: first, Margot can either choose to help Geralt or refuse to provide help; second, the troll couple can either accept or reject Geralt’s solution to their conflict. Each of these choices affects the outcome of the narrative creating three possible timelines. The first timeline contains events favorable to Geralt. In this timeline, Margot agrees to help Geralt and the troll couple accept Geralt’s solution leading him to find Triss. Fig. 5 shows a visualization of this outcome as the reality timeline for our narrative. We can see that Geralt was able to successfully track Triss’s last known location, gather information from friends, resolve a conflict between the trolls, and meet Triss. Note that in this visualization we are showing the default, reality timeline and all links are drawn with 100% opacity. We can also observe all single-entity events in the narrative in this visualization. In the second timeline, the trolls reject Geralt’s solution to their conflict. Fig. 6 shows a visualization of this unfavorable outcome as diegetic timeline overlaid on top of the reality timeline. While most of the events are same in both timelines, the diegetic timeline ends at the event “Speak to She-Troll.” The reduced opacity of the reality timeline allows the user to compare common sections of the two timelines, even when one of them is smaller than the other. In the third timeline, Margot refuses to help Geralt preventing him from progressing further on his quest. This is the shortest timeline in our narrative.\n\nFrom ’’Yarn: Generating Storyline Visualizations Using HTN Planning”:\n\nFor our second example we use a fictional narrative scenario based on the popular sitcom Friends. In this narrative, Ross’s plan is to take Rachel on a date. To do so, he must acquire more information about her, find some way of talking to her, ensure she is positively disposed towards him, and eventually ask her out. He can acquire more information about her in a number of ways including calling her mother, or asking Phoebe about her by either call or text. To ensure she is in a positive mood, he can either give her a gift or say nice things to her, and finally he can either ask her out himself or ask for Phoebe’s help. To illustrate causality of events in the narrative timeline, we have set up the operator functions for Rachel such that she is more inclined to say yes to Ross if he talks to her mother rather than requesting Phoebe’s help. Additionally, Rachel’s probability of accepting Ross’s proposal is also dependent on how impressed she is by him when he asks her. There are four choice points in this narrative: three for Ross, and one for Rachel. The choices made by Ross create 12 alternate timelines, each illustrating a different way in which he can ask Rachel out. Towards the end of each timeline Rachel can decide to either reply yes to Ross, or reply no, creating a total of 24 timelines. Fig. 7 shows a visualization where Rachel agrees to go out with Ross in both timelines. While the timelines result in the same outcome, and visually look the same, we can inspect the labels on top of the events in Ross’s timeline to identify the differences. Lighter labels correspond to the reality timeline, while darker labels correspond to the diegetic timeline. In the reality timeline, Ross decided to give a gift to Rachel after talking to her mom, while in the diegetic timeline he decided to act friendly with her. Fig. 8 shows another visualization for the same narrative. In this example we can see the effect of causal conditions set in the operator functions for Rachel. In the reality timeline, Rachel decided not to go out with Ross because he asked Phoebe for help by messaging her. On the other hand, she agreed to go out with him in the diegetic timeline because in this case Ross decided to talk to her mother.\n\n\n\n\nFrom ’’Yarn: Generating Storyline Visualizations Using HTN Planning”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternet Mapping Project\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original Internet Mapping Project started at Bell lab in 1998.

While this data is not quite a tree (or even connected, or planar), we extract a subset to create a tree with 500 nodes. The maximum node degree of this tree is 5 and the radius is 14.\n\n\n\n\nFrom The Mathematics Genealogy Project:\n\n\n\nFrom “Visualizing Evolving Trees”:\n\n\n\nFig. 4: Layouts from DynNoSlice, DynaGraph, Dagre, Radial, ImPrEd, DynaCola and DynaSafe of the same evolving math genealogy tree; each row adds six new nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the data we collected, we also found several instances of custom-made datasets. We consider custom-made datasets either edits to pre-existing datasets, where the authors found it necessary to either split or modify the dataset in a particular way, or datasets completely made up from scratch using random generators or custom-made code. This can happen in cases where the authors of a paper needed a dataset containing particular characteristics which was not easy to find in the wild, so a new dataset was crafted.\nFor instance, consider the case where the authors of a paper develop an algorithm that works on hypergraphs. They want to test that the algorithm works, and test its performance on hypergraphs of various sizes, but datasets containing hypergraphs are difficult to find. For this reason, the authors craft one dataset synthetically, or take a pre-existing dataset and edit it so that it now contains hyperedges.\nWe split custom-made datasets in three categories, with their occurrences in the corpus of papers illustrated below:\n\n{ \n  let d = []\n  \n  let allbenchmarkdatasets = [...new Set(literature.map(l =&gt; l[\"Dataset tag clean\"].split(\",\").map(d =&gt; d.trim())).flat())].filter(a =&gt; a != \"\")\n\n  for (let dataset of allbenchmarkdatasets){\n    if (!dataset.includes(\"Custom\")) continue;\n    let literature_entries_with_this_dataset = literature.filter(l =&gt; l[\"Dataset tag clean\"].includes(dataset))\n\n    d.push({\"dataset\": dataset, \"count\": literature_entries_with_this_dataset.length})\n  }\n  \n  return Plot.plot({\n    color: {\n      // legend: true,\n      type: \"categorical\",\n      // domain: d3.range(10).map((d, i) =&gt; `Category ${i + 1}`),\n      scheme: \"Tableau10\" // use the \"accent\" scheme\n    },\n    y: {\n      // tickFormat: \"s\"\n    },\n    marks: [\n      Plot.barX(d, {x: \"count\", y: \"dataset\", fill: \"dataset\",inset: 2, sort: {y: \"x\", reverse: true}}),\n      Plot.axisY({label: null, lineWidth: 12, marginLeft: 150}),\n    ]\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The chart shows what type of edits were made to datasets, or how they were generated. Non-Replicable edits or generation of datasets where the majority in the corpus of papers we collected.\n\n\n\n\nReplicable datasets indicate cases where the authors have given enough information so that the experiment can be replicated exactly as it was run by the authors of a paper, or closely enough that the results obtained reflect the published ones very closely. This includes cases where either the authors published the entire dataset they used, they published the code they used to generate the dataset, or include an exact description of the steps they took to generate it.\nReproducible datasets are cases where the authors described the steps they took to generate and/or edit their datasets, but not in-depth enough so that the exact same graphs can be reproduced, and did not redistribute it. Results can still be reproduces somewhat closely if the authors took care to report enough information about their graphs.\nFor non-replicable datasets, we indicate cases where the authors did not distribute their datasets and did not include enough information in the paper so that their results could be replicated.\nThis information is closely tied to the distribution of supplemental material in papers, that is shown in the chart below:\n\n{ \n  let d = []\n  \n  let allbenchmarkdatasets = [...new Set(literature.map(l =&gt; l[\"Supplemental material (Multi-select)\"].split(\",\").map(d =&gt; d.trim())).flat())].filter(a =&gt; a != \"\")\n\n  for (let dataset of allbenchmarkdatasets){\n    let literature_entries_with_this_dataset = literature.filter(l =&gt; l[\"Supplemental material (Multi-select)\"].includes(dataset))\n\n    if (dataset == \"Yes\") continue;\n    // capitalize first letter\n    dataset = dataset.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + dataset.slice(1)\n\n    d.push({\"dataset\": dataset, \"count\": literature_entries_with_this_dataset.length})\n  }\n  \n  return Plot.plot({\n    color: {\n      // legend: true,\n      type: \"categorical\",\n      // domain: d3.range(10).map((d, i) =&gt; `Category ${i + 1}`),\n      scheme: \"Tableau10\" // use the \"accent\" scheme\n    },\n    y: {\n      // tickFormat: \"s\"\n    },\n    marks: [\n      Plot.barX(d, {x: \"count\", y: \"dataset\", fill: \"dataset\",inset: 2, sort: {y: \"x\", reverse: true}}),\n      Plot.axisY({label: null, lineWidth: 12, marginLeft: 150}),\n    ]\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: What is distributed as supplemental material with papers? Most papers just distribute an extended version of their content, while another large chunk in our analysis did not distribute any.\n\n\n\n\nThis discussion is part of a larger discourse on research replicability, that is gaining traction in the scientific community. The ACM, for instance, has a policy on artifact review and badging, where authors are encouraged to submit their artifacts for review, and if they pass, they receive a badge that indicates the artifact is available for review. This is a step towards making research more replicable and reproducible, and we hope that our work will contribute to this effort.\nSee, e.g., ACM’s definitions at https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current."

    "text": "1 Discussion, Limitations and Conclusion\nHaving reliable and easy ways to compare algorithm performances on a variety of graphs with different features is an important aspect of graph drawing research.\nIn this work, we presented a comprehensive benchmark dataset collection for graph layout algorithms. Compiling, organizing, and making a wide array of datasets with diverse characteristics accessible not only facilitates rigorous and fair comparisons of algorithmic performance but also addresses critical issues of replicability and reproducibility in research. The Graph Benchmark Datasets website, along with the efforts for long-term archival, is an effort towards maintaining these valuable resources available to the community.\nThe work we did for the collection process doesn’t come without limitations. We focused on the Graph Drawing conference as the main venue to begin collecting papers, which limits the completeness of our search. There could be many relevant datasets that we did not find to include here. Indeed, in no way we consider this collection comprehensive, but rather a starting point.\nThere is a large number of interesting follow-up questions that could be tackled starting from the data we collected, and information that could be gathered from cross-referencing the datasets with the literature. For instance, it would be interesting to study the spread of a dataset based on its features and how it has been distributed. The following is a chart comparing the year of publication of a dataset with the year of publication of papers that use the dataset:\n\n{\n    const svg = d3.create(\"svg\")\n        .attr(\"viewBox\", [0, 0, 500, 420])\n\n    let xscale = d3.scaleLinear()\n        .domain([1970, 2025])\n        .range([170, 480])\n\n    // append xscale to the svg with a tick every 5 years, and format it as integers\n    svg.append(\"g\")\n        .attr(\"transform\", \"translate(0, 400)\")\n        .call(d3.axisBottom(xscale).ticks(5).tickFormat(d3.format(\"d\")))\n\n    let dataset_list = benchmark_datasets.filter(d =&gt; d.Name != \"Chess Games\" && d.Name != \"Pajek\" && d.Name != \"World Bank Trade Data\" && d.Name != \"Scotch Graph Collection\" && d.Name != \"GION\" && d.Name != \"Network Repository\" && d.Name != \"Padia Stories\" && d.Name != \"Medical Patient Records\" && d.Name != \"Car Features\" && d.Name != \"Internet Mapping Project\" && d.Name != \"Autonomous System Network\" && d.Name != \"Tobler's Flow Mapper\" && d.Name != \"Protein Interactions (Publications)\" && d.Name != \"Neural Network\" && d.Name != \"Investment Interdependence\" && d.Name != \"SteinLib\" && d.Name != \"Control Flow Graphs\" && d.Name != \"Co-Phylogenetic Trees\" && d.Name != \"FM3\" && d.Name != \"Complete Graphs\" && d.Name != \"World Maps\" && d.Name != \"WebCompute\" && d.Name != \"KnownCR\" && d.Name != \"California\" && d.Name != \"Militarized Interstate Disputes (MID)\" && d.Name != \"World Greenhouse Gas Emissions\" && d.Name != \"Biological Pathways (KEGG)\" && d.Name != \"Business Processes\" && d.Name != \"Tree of Life\" && d.Name != \"Amazon\" && d.Name != \"Mathematics Genealogy\" && d.Name != \"RandDAG\" && d.Name != \"Pert DAG\")\n\n    for (let i in dataset_list){\n        const dataset = dataset_list[i]\n        \n        svg.append(\"text\")\n            .attr(\"x\", 150)\n            .attr(\"y\", i * 20 + 25)\n            .attr(\"font-size\", \"x-small\")\n            .attr(\"text-anchor\", \"end\")\n            .text(dataset.Name)\n    // append a dotted line for each dataset\n        svg.append(\"line\")\n            .attr(\"x1\", 160)\n            .attr(\"y1\", i * 20 + 30)\n            .attr(\"x2\", 480)\n            .attr(\"y2\", i * 20 + 30)\n            .attr(\"stroke\", \"#ccc\")\n            .attr(\"stroke-dasharray\", \"2,4\")\n\n        if (dataset[\"Origin paper plaintext\"] == undefined) continue;\n\n        for (let origin_paper_name of dataset[\"Origin paper plaintext\"].split(\",\")){\n            if (origin_paper_name == undefined || origin_paper_name == \"\") continue;\n            let bibkey = \"bib\"\n            if (origin_paper_name == undefined) continue;\n            let origin_paper = paper_source.find(p =&gt; p.Name == origin_paper_name)\n            if (origin_paper == undefined) {\n                origin_paper = literature.find(p =&gt; p.Name == origin_paper_name)\n                bibkey = \"Bibtex\"\n            }\n            if (origin_paper == undefined) continue;\n            \n            let year = parseInt(origin_paper[bibkey].match(/year\\s*=\\s*[\"{]?(\\d{4})[\"}]?/i)[1])\n\n            svg.append(\"circle\")\n                .attr(\"cx\", xscale(year))\n                .attr(\"cy\", i * 20 + 20)\n                .attr(\"r\", 3)\n                .attr(\"fill\", \"#666\")\n        }\n\n        for (let lit of dataset[\"Related to Literature - Algorithm (Dataset tag relations) 1\"].split(\",\")){\n            let lit_paper = literature.find(p =&gt; p.Name == lit.split(\"(\")[0].trim().replace(\"\\n\", \"\"))\n            if (lit_paper == undefined) continue;\n            let lyear = lit_paper[\"Year\"]\n\n            svg.append(\"circle\")\n                .attr(\"cx\", xscale(lyear))  \n                .attr(\"cy\", i * 20 + 20)\n                .attr(\"r\", 2)\n                .style(\"opacity\", 0.3)\n                .attr(\"fill\", \"red\")\n        }\n    }\n\n    let domain = svg.selectAll(\".domain\").attr(\"stroke\", \"#ccc\")\n    svg.selectAll(\".tick line\").attr(\"stroke\", \"#ccc\")\n    domain.selectAll(\"text\").attr(\"fill\", \"#ccc\")\n    domain.selectAll(\"text\").attr(\"font-size\", \"x-small\")\n\n    return svg.node();\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Date of publication of a dataset, compared to the dates of publications of papers using the dataset. A gray dot indicates the publication of the paper of the dataset, while a red dot indicates the publication of a paper that uses the dataset. Darker red dots mean more papers with the same datasets being published in the same year. Note that, in several instances, the paper presenting the dataset can be published after the dataset has already been used several times.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional questions that would be interesting to explore could be:\n\nHas the type of benchmark datasets used in the literature changed over time?\nThe datasets we collected definitely went through changes in the years — some merged, some underwent changes. How did these datasets evolve over time?\nHow has the inclusion of supplemental material in literature changed?\n\nWe leave these questions for new and exciting future work. In the meantime, we hope that the Graph Benchmark Datasets website will be an appreciated resource for the community."

Because of its size, you decide to slice up the large dataset in many smaller files, so you can run tests. This particular dataset, in addition to being a challenging problem because of its size, also has an interesting distribution of connection densities: some nodes are extremely well connected, while others are much less connected. Indeed, the dataset is comprised of a collection of emails sent by Enron executives - between themselves or between other employees of the company. Because of how the dataset is constructed - where only the emails from the executives are taken into account - it has a distinctive skew in the connectedness of the data: 158 nodes are extremely well connected, while the rest of the nodes are much less connected. Because of this, there’s uncountable mistakes that can be done through slicing this graph: for instance, slicing it so that the subset includes a less dense section of the entire graph will fail to provide a representative section.\n\nWhile the creation of a synthetic dataset is a perfectly viable way to produce a benchmark set, in addition to replicability criteria (as discussed above), we also have to pay particular attention to a number of statistics related to the structure of graphs — both when generating new datasets, and when slicing up existing datasets to reduce their size, or to create more graphs from a single, larger graph.\nComparing two synthetic graph collections meaningfully is not straightforward. Without shared generation procedures or metadata, it’s difficult to claim that they represent comparable input conditions for layout evaluation. A number of structural and contextual features may affect comparability — including, for example, graph size (nodes and edges), density, and distribution of components or motifs.

    "text": "3.1 Data Processing\nFurther complicating the replicability and reproducibility issues previously outlined is the problem of storing data in a consistent format. Datasets cited in different papers link to downloads for which the graph structure is very difficult to piece together (for instance, if it is in an uncommon format)—most commonly, paper authors write code to extract this structure for their specific needs, but this code is often tedious to recreate (if the authors went through the trouble of meticulously describing their process in the paper) or difficult and time-consuming to reappropriate (if it is contained in their supplemental materials, and they still exist on the web). In the worst case, both of these options are lost over time and the original graphs used become impossible to recreate. Hence, storing and organizing this data in multiple accessible formats is of great importance for the replicability of these works and for further research in the field.\nFor each dataset included in our repository, we have performed the work required to extract the graph structure per the original author’s specifications, or linked to an established network repository such as SNAP or SuiteSparse Matrix Collection that hosts the files. Writing custom code for this purpose was necessary for 32 of the 49 included datasets. Our code is available at github.com/VisDunneRight/benchmark_sets_analysis_data/.\nWe chose to convert and store several of the datasets in a uniform JSON representation because it is a highly versatile and easily accessible format that allowed us to easily represent a large and varied amount of characteristics that different graphs might have—such as nodes having associated timestamps, labels, or belonging to a clusters, and edges having weights. The style of JSON representation we used for graphs is based on several d3 examples, such as the one used in the d3 documentation, and is the same format used by the JSON read/write functions in NetworkX. For ease and accessibility, we have also converted and made available all graphs in three additional commonly-used formats: GraphML, GEXF, and GML. All of the formats contain the same information, including all of the additional attributes nodes or edges might have."

    "section": "4.1 Classification of the Datasets",
    "text": "4.1 Classification of the Datasets\nThe datasets we collected are divided in different categories: the categorization we used is the same as the one used in Di Bartolomeo et al. (2024). The following is a brief explanation of the categories used, which are explained in deeper detail in each one of the corresponding chapters.\n\nUniform Benchmark (Section 4.1.1): Datasets that are standalone widely used collections of graphs featuring uniform characteristics - usually simple, generic graphs, often used in evaluations that run over thousands of graphs to report average completion times, or other experiments where the reported metrics are usually aggregated.\nEstablished Network Repository (Section 4.1.2): A collection of individual, or groups of graphs, part of a larger repository. These datasets are often used in evaluations that require a diverse set of graphs, or when the evaluation is focused on a specific type of graph. These collections usually also report on graphs with their own statistics or visualizations, providing a summary of the dataset. This category also includes Subsets (Section 4.1.2.10).\nSingle Graphs (Section 4.1.3): The data used is comprised of one individual graph, which often contains special characteristics making it particularly relevant for the evaluation at hand.\nAggregate Collections (Section 4.1.4): Collections of graphs focusing on one specific context (such as forum posts, or airline routes) due to the given context having a special set of features that is relevant for a graph layout algorithm.\n\nThe type of collection informs various aspects of an evaluation, such as which results are relevant to report. For this discussion, we refer to Di Bartolomeo et al. (2024), where the authors link the type of collection in the context of graph layout evaluations.\nThe following visualization shows the amount of datasets we collected per category:\n\n{ \n  let d = []\n  \n  let collection_type = benchmark_datasets.map(a =&gt; a[\"Type of Collection\"]);\n\n  for (let c of [... new Set(collection_type)]){\n    if (c == \"Skip\" || c == \"Missed it\") continue;\n    let count = collection_type.filter(a =&gt; a == c).length;\n    if (c.includes(\"No report\")) c = \"Established Network Repository\";\n    if (c.includes(\"Lost\")) continue;\n    d.push({\"collection_type\": c, \"count\": count})\n  }\n  \n  return Plot.plot({\n    color: {\n      scheme: \"Tableau10\" \n    },\n    marks: [\n      Plot.barX(d, {x: \"count\", y: \"collection_type\", fill: \"collection_type\", inset: 2, sort: {y: \"x\", reverse: true}}),\n      Plot.axisY({label: null, lineWidth: 12, marginLeft: 150}),\n    ]\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Occurrences of datasets we collected per category. Unform benchmark datasets were the majority.\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, some of the datasets used in layout algorithm evaluations are not accessible anymore. Where possible, we still collected and reported all the information contained in the papers about the datasets, so that we can conserve an idea of what they contained. This phenomenon, as well as the information we could collect, is discussed in Lost and Unavailable Datasets (Section 4.1.5).\n\n{ \n  let d = []\n  \n  let collection_type = benchmark_datasets.map(a =&gt; a[\"Type of Collection\"]);\n\n  for (let c of [... new Set(collection_type)]){\n    if (c == \"Skip\" || c == \"Missed it\") continue;\n    let count = collection_type.filter(a =&gt; a == c).length;\n    if (c.includes(\"No report\")) c = \"Established Network Repository\";\n    if (!c.includes(\"Lost\")) continue;\n    d.push({\"collection_type\": c, \"count\": count})\n  }\n  \n  return Plot.plot({\n    color: {\n      scheme: \"PiYg\" \n    },\n    x: {\n      domain: [0, 15]\n    },\n    marks: [\n      Plot.barX(d, {x: \"count\", y: \"collection_type\", fill: \"collection_type\", inset: 2, sort: {y: \"x\", reverse: true}}),\n      Plot.axisY({label: null, lineWidth: 12, marginLeft: 150}),\n    ]\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Unfortunately, 9 of the datasets we found being used in the literature were either lost or no longer accessible.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we include a discussion on Custom-made Datasets (Section 4.1.6), synthetically generated datasets for the purpose of an experiment.\nEach dataset also contains a number of graph features specific to the graphs contained in it. Authors might want to use a dataset that contains a specific feature, such as a graph with a high number of nodes, or a graph with a specific structure. The following interactive filtering systems allows for filtering of datasets (and papers) based on the features they contain.\n\n\n\n\n\nType to search for datasets by name or feature. Results will appear here.\n\n\n\nconsole.log(benchmark_datasets)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocument.getElementById('dataset-search').addEventListener('input', function(e) {\n    const query = e.target.value.toLowerCase();\n    // Example: filter and log matching dataset names\n    const matches = benchmark_datasets.filter(d =&gt; {\n      const nameMatch = d.Name && d.Name.toLowerCase().includes(query);\n      const featureMatch = d[\"graph features handled\"] && d[\"graph features handled\"].toLowerCase().includes(query);\n      return nameMatch || featureMatch;\n    });\n    // You can replace this with code to update the UI with the filtered results\n    const resultsContainer = document.getElementById('search-results');\n    resultsContainer.innerHTML = ''; // Clear previous results\n    if (matches.length &gt; 0 && query.length &gt; 0) {\n        resultsContainer.innerHTML = `&lt;strong&gt;Found ${matches.length} matching datasets:&lt;/strong&gt;`;\n        matches.forEach(match =&gt; {\n            const resultItem = document.createElement('div');\n            resultItem.className = 'search-result-item';\n            resultItem.innerHTML = `&lt;a class=\"dataset-link\" href=\"#${name_cleanup(match.Name)}\"&gt;${match.Name}&lt;/a&gt; - ${match[\"graph features handled\"] || \"No features listed\"}`;\n            resultsContainer.appendChild(resultItem);\n        });\n    } else if (query.length &gt; 0) {\n        resultsContainer.innerHTML = '&lt;i&gt;No matching datasets found.&lt;/i&gt;';\n    } else {\n        resultsContainer.innerHTML = '&lt;i&gt;Type to search for datasets by name or feature. Results will appear here.&lt;/i&gt;';\n    }\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTag-filtered Navigation\n\n\n\nThe following interactive filtering system is an initial overview over the contents of the paper, and can be used to navigate and identify datasets and papers easily. The left column contains all the properties used to tag graphs in the datasets (additional information about the nature of these tags can be found in Section 3 and Section 3.1). Each tag has an associated checkbox: selecting a tag (or more than one) will filter the datasets and papers to only show those that contain the selected tags. The middle column contains the datasets, and the right column contains the papers. Clicking on a dataset or paper will scroll the page to the corresponding section in the paper. The datasets and papers are sorted alphabetically by name and citation name, respectively. The tags, datasets, and papers are generated from the data in the repository, and are updated automatically when the data changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\nDatsets\n\n\nPapers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirlines, Migrations, and Air Traffic\n\n\nAmazon\n\n\nAssorted Collaboration Network\n\n\nAssorted Fiscal Network\n\n\nAT&T\n\n\nAutonomous System Network\n\n\nBiological Pathways (KEGG)\n\n\nBlogposts, Tweets, and Forums\n\n\nBusiness Processes\n\n\nCalifornia\n\n\nCar Features\n\n\nChess Games\n\n\nWorld Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\n\nCo-Phylogenetic Trees\n\n\nCode Dependency Graphs\n\n\nComplete Graphs\n\n\nWorld Maps\n\n\nControl Flow Graphs\n\n\nEnron\n\n\nFM3\n\n\nGION\n\n\nGraphviz Examples\n\n\nInternet Mapping Project\n\n\nInvestment Interdependence\n\n\nKnownCR\n\n\nMathematics Genealogy\n\n\nMatrix Market\n\n\nMedical Patient Records\n\n\nMilitarized Interstate Disputes (MID)\n\n\nNetwork Repository\n\n\nNeural Network\n\n\nNorth DAGs\n\n\nPadia Stories\n\n\nPajek\n\n\nProtein Interactions (Publications)\n\n\nRandDAG\n\n\nRome-Lib\n\n\nScotch Graph Collection\n\n\nSNAP (Stanford Network Analysis Platform)\n\n\nSocial Networks\n\n\nStanford GraphBase\n\n\nSteinLib\n\n\nStorylines (Movie Plots)\n\n\nSuiteSparse Matrix Collection\n\n\nTransportation Networks\n\n\nTree of Life\n\n\nWalshaw\n\n\nWebCompute\n\n\nWorld Bank Trade Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Ahmed et al. 2020)\n\n\n(Alegrı́a et al. 2021)\n\n\n(Angori et al. 2019)\n\n\n(Alessio Arleo et al. 2019)\n\n\n(Bach, Pietriga, and Fekete 2014)\n\n\n(Ballweg et al. 2018)\n\n\n(Barnes and Hut 1986)\n\n\n(Di Bartolomeo et al. 2021)\n\n\n(Michael A.

These benchmarks are often used in large-scale evaluations where experiments are run on thousands of graphs, and results are reported as aggregated metrics such as average running time or layout quality scores.\nWhat distinguishes these benchmarks is that they are designed to test the general performance of layout algorithms across a wide range of input sizes and densities, rather than being tied to a particular real-world context or graph semantics. This is different from other collections presented later in this section, which may focus on graphs with specific structural patterns (e.g., social networks, hierarchical trees, storyline structures) or graphs drawn from a single domain.\nThe first of these collapsible sections is shown already expanded, to give an example of the content that can be found in each of them. The content is generated dynamically based on the data we collected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRome-Lib\n\n\n\n\n\nRome-Lib is, as previously discussed, the most common benchmark dataset, due to its already established popularity, its ease of use and access, and the many properties that are already known about it. It was first introduced in (Battista et al. 1997) and presented in their paper ”An experimental comparison of four graph drawing algorithms”. Mostly “real” networks such as software companies, government, software engineering books, database design, and journal articles on visualization. Originally sent as an extended abstract to Computational Geometry in 1995 (Di Battista, Garg, and Liotta 1995). It contains exclusively Genericgraphs (e.g., undirected, non-layered, without pre-established clusters…), although some of the research that uses it enhances with additional attributes (such as performing a rank assignment step). Information about optimal crossings can be found as part of WebCompute.\n\nOriginally found at: http://www.graphdrawing.org/data.html\n\n\n\nDownload formatted data:  GEXF GML GRAPHML JSON\n\n\n\nSize: 11534 graphs, 10 to 100 nodes, 9 to 158 edges\n\n\n\nOrigin paper: \n\n\n\n(Battista et al. 1997)\n\n\nAn experimental comparison of four graph drawing algorithms\n\n\n\n\n(Di Battista, Garg, and Liotta 1995)\n\n\nAn experimental comparison of three graph drawing algorithms (extended abstract)\n\n\n\n\nUsage examples: \n\n\n\n(Buchheim et al. 2008)\n\n\nA branch-and-cut approach to the crossing number problem\n\n\nGeneric\n\n\n\n\n(Chimani et al. 2010)\n\n\nLayer-Free Upward Crossing Minimization\n\n\nDirected edgesLayered graphsN-layers\n\n\n\n\n(Chimani, Gutwenger, and Mutzel 2006)\n\n\nExperiments on Exact Crossing Minimization Using Column Generation\n\n\nGeneric\n\n\n\n\n(Di Bartolomeo, Riedewald, et al. 2022)\n\n\nStratisfimal Layout: A modular optimization model for laying out layered node-link network visualizations\n\n\nClusters (pre-existing)Compound graphsLayered graphsN-layers\n\n\n\n\n(Klammler, Mchedlidze, and Pak 2018)\n\n\nAesthetic Discrimination of Graph Layouts\n\n\nGeneric\n\n\n\n\n(Chimani, Mutzel, and Bomze 2008)\n\n\nA New Approach to Exact Crossing Minimization\n\n\nGeneric\n\n\n\n\n(Emden R.

The set contains 11 389 graphs that consist of 10 to 100 nodes and 9 to 158 edges. These graphs were generated from a core set of 112 “real life” graphs used in database design and software engineering applications. Most of the graphs are sparse, which is a common property in most application areas of automatic graph drawing. The average ratio between the number of edges and the number of nodes of the graphs from the benchmark set is about 1.35.\n\nFrom “Layer-free upward crossing minimization”:\n\nThe Rome graphs [Di Battista et al. 1997] are a widely used benchmark set in graph drawing, obtained from a basic set of 112 real-world graphs. It contains 11,528 instances with 10 through 100 nodes and 9 through 158 edges. Although the graphs are originally undirected, they have been used as directed graphs—by artificially directing the edges according to the node order given in the input files—for showing the performance of the mixed-upward planarization approach [Eiglsperger et al. 2003]. In this case, all edges are directed and the graphs are acyclic; hence, the mixed-upward planarization approach turns into an upward planarization method.\n\nFrom “A New Approach to Exact Crossing Minimization”:\n\nWe say graphs are trivial, if they are planar or if the heuristic achieves a planarization with only one crossing, as in these cases we need not prove optimality. The Rome library contains 7172 non-trivial graphs.\n\nFrom “An Experimental Comparison of Four Graph Drawing Algorithms”\n\nOur test graph generation strategy is as follows. First, we have focused on the important application area of database and software visualization, where Entity-Relationship diagrams and Data-Flow diagrams are usually displayed with orthogonal drawings. Second, we have collected 112 “real life” graphs with number of vertices between 10 and 100, from now on called core graphs, from the following sources:\n\n\n• 54% of the graphs have been obtained from major Italian software companies (especially from Database Informatica) and large government organization (including the Italian Internal Revenue Service and the Italian National Advisory Council for Computer Applications in the Government (Autorita’ per l’Informatica nella Pubblica Amministrazione)); • 33% of the graphs were taken from well-known reference books in software engineering [18] and database design [1], and from journal articles on software visualization in the recent issues of Information Systems and the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering; • 13% of the graphs were extracted from theses in software and database visualization written by students at the University of Rome “La Sapienza”.\n\n\nOur approach is based on the following scheme. We defined several primitive operations for updating graphs, which correspond to the typical operations performed by designers of Entity-Relationship and Data-Flow Diagrams, and attributed a certain probability to each of them. More specifically, the updating primitives we have used are the following: InsertEdge, which inserts a new edge between two existing vertices; DeleteEdge, which deletes an existing edge; InsertVertex, which splits an existing edge into two edges by inserting a new vertex; DeleteVertex, which deletes a vertex and all its incident edges; and MakeVertex, which creates a new vertex and connects it to a subset of vertices. The test graphs were then generated in several iterations starting from the core graphs by applying random sequences of operations with a “genetic” mechanism. Namely, at each iteration a new set of test graphs was obtained by applying a random sequence of operations to the current test set. Each new graph was then evaluated for “suitability”, and those found not suitable were discarded. The probability of each primitive operation was varied at the end of each iteration. The evaluation of the suitability of the generated graphs was conducted using both objective and subjective analyses. The objective analysis consisted of determining whether the new graph had similar structural properties with respect to the core graph it was derived from. We have taken into account parameters like the average ratio between number of vertices and number of edges and the average number of biconnected components. The subjective analysis consisted in a visual inspection of the new graph and an assessment by expert users of Entity-Relationship and Data-Flow diagrams of its similarity to a “real-life” diagram. For obvious reasons, the subjective analysis has been done on a randomly selected subset of the graphs.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom ”An Experimental Comparison of Four Graph Drawing Algorithms”:\n\n\n\nFrom “Experimental Analysis of the Accessibility of Drawings with Few Segments”:\n\n\n\nFrom: Deep Neural Network for DrawiNg Networks, (DNN)2:\n\n\n\nFig 5.

We considered two typical contexts where DAGs play a fundamental role, namely software engineering and project planning.\n\n\nThe first set of test DAGs are what we call the North DAGs. They are obtained from a collection of directed graphs [28], that North collected at AT&T Bell Labs by running for two years Draw DAG, an e-mail graph drawing service that accepts directed graphs formatted as e-mail messages and returns messages with the corresponding drawings [27].\n\n\nOriginally, the North DAGs consisted of 5114 directed graphs, whose number of vertices varied in the range 1 … 7602. However, the density of the directed graphs with a number of vertices that did not fall in the range 10 … 100 was very low (see also the statistics in [28]); since such directed graphs represent a very sparse statistical population we decided to discard them. Then we noted that many directed graphs were isomorphic; since the vertices of the directed graphs have labels associated with them, the problem is tractable. For each isomorphism class, we kept only one representative directed graph. Also, we deleted the directed graphs where subgraphs were specified as clusters, to be drawn in their own distinct rectangular region of the layout, because constrained algorithms are beyond the scope of this study. This filtering left us with 1277 directed graphs.\n\n\nStill, 491 directed graphs were not connected and this was a problem for running algorithms implemented in G D W (they assume input directed graphs to be connected). Instead of discarding the directed graphs, we followed a more practical approach, by randomly adding a minimum set of directed edges that makes each directed graph connected. Finally, we made the directed graph acyclic, where necessary, by applying some heuristics for inverting the direction of a small subset of edges.\n\n\nWe then ran a first set of experiments and produced the statistics by grouping the DAGs by number of vertices. Although the comparison among the algorithms looked consistent (the produced plots never oddly overlapped), each single plot was not satisfactory, because it showed peaks and valleys. We went back to study the test suite and observed that grouping them by number of vertices was not the best approach. In fact, the North DAGs come from very heterogeneous sources, mainly representing different phases of various software engineering projects; as a result, directed graphs with more or less the same number of vertices may be either very dense or very sparse.\n\n\nSince most of the analyzed quality measures strongly depend on the number of edges of the DAG (e.g. area, number of bends, and number of crossings), we decided that a better approach was to group the DAGs by number of edges. After some tests, we clustered the DAGs into nine groups, each with at least 40 DAGs, so that the number of edges in the DAGs belonging to group i, 1 ≤ i ≤ 9, is in the range 10 i … 10 i+9 (see Fig. 3). The resulting test suite consists of 1158 DAGs, each with edges in the range 10 … 99.\n\nFrom “Layer-Free Upward Crossing Minimization”:\n\nNorth DAGs. The North DAGs have been introduced in an experimental comparison of algorithms for drawing DAGs [Di Battista et al. 2000]. The benchmark set contains 1,158 DAGs collected by Stephen North, which were slightly modified by Di Battista et al. The graphs are grouped into nine sets, where set i contains graphs with 10 i to 10 i+9 arcs for i=1, …, 9.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “Drawing Directed Acyclic Graphs: An Experimental Study”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom “A Natural Quadratic Approach to the Generalized Graph Layering Problem”:\n\n\n\nFrom “A Flow Formulation for Horizontal Coordinate Assignment with Prescribed Width”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth DAGs\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the same collection as AT&T, but referred to as North DAGs in the papers we analyzed.

The instances contain graphs with \\(3 \\leq i \\leq 7\\) and \\(j \\geq i\\) such that \\(ij \\leq 250\\). \\(G_i \\times P_j\\): The Cartesian product of the path on \\(j+1\\) vertices with one of the 21 non-isomorphic connected graphs on 5 vertices, where \\(i\\) denotes which of the 21.

The linked dataset includes both the complete graphs \\(K_n\\) for \\(5≤n≤50\\) and the complete bipartite graphs \\(K_{n_1,n_2}\\) for \\(5≤n1,n2≤40\\). Crossing number is conjectured for most of these, and while not proven, we found these used in papers to validate minimum crossing numbers. We also note that the papers in our literature review did not provide example figures.\n\nDownload formatted data:  GEXF GML GRAPHML JSON\n\n\n\nSize: 5-80 nodes, 10-1600 edges\n\n\n\nNumber of Graphs: 1342\n\n\n\nUsage examples: \n\n\n\n(Clancy, Haythorpe, and Newcombe 2019b)\n\n\nAn effective crossing minimisation heuristic based on star insertion\n\n\nGeneric\n\n\n\n\nStatistics\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptions from Literature\nFrom “An effective crossing minimisation heuristic based on star insertion”:\n\nComplete graphs - Although the crossing number of the complete graph \\(K_n\\) is not known for for \\(n ≥ 13\\), the value is conjectured, and typically assumed to be correct. We compare the nine combinations of schemes to see how close to the conjectured value each of them is able to get, for various sizes of complete graphs up to \\(n = 50\\). We indicate how many crossings are obtained after the initial embedding, as well as at the conclusion of the heuristic. We also provide the runtimes, again separated into time spent producing the initial embedding, and time spent in the main loop of the heuristic.\n\n\nComplete bipartite graphs - Much like the complete graphs, the crossing number of the complete bipartite graph \\(K_{n1,n2}\\) is only known in general for \\(n_1 ≤ 6\\), but the value is conjectured and typically assumed to be correct. Again, we compare the nine combinations of schemes to see how close to the conjectured value they can get for values up to \\(n_1,n_2 = 40\\), and report the same data as for the Complete graphs.\n\n\nThe crossing number of the complete graph \\(K_n\\) is conjectured (e.g. see Guy [25]) to be equal to \\(H(n) := 1/4 \\left\\lfloor n/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor (n − 1)/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor(n − 2)/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor (n − 3)/2\\right\\rfloor\\). Although this conjecture is widely believed to be correct, it has only been confirmed for \\(n ≤ 12\\) despite considerable effort to extend the results further [30]. We ran the graphs \\(K_n\\) for \\(5 ≤ n ≤ 50\\). Each graph was run with 100 random permutations and the minimum found solution was compared to \\(H(n)\\) by computing the percent relative deviation from \\(H(n)\\)… For these graphs, we observe that when \\(n\\) was odd, every scheme combination was able to obtain a drawing with \\(H(n)\\) crossings. However, when \\(n\\) was even, each scheme reached a value which was usually very close but not equal to \\(H(n)\\).\n\n\nThe crossing number of the complete bipartite graph \\(K_{n_1,n_2}\\) is conjectured (e.g. see Zarankiewicz [35]) to be equal to \\(Z(n_1, n_2) := \\left\\lfloor n_1/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor (n_1 − 1)/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor n_2/2\\right\\rfloor \\left\\lfloor (n_2 − 1)/2\\right\\rfloor\\). We ran the graphs \\(K_{n_1,n_2}\\) for \\(5 ≤ n1 ≤ n2 ≤ 40\\). Each graph was run with 100 random permutations and the minimum found solution was compared to \\(Z(n_1,n_2)\\)… As can be seen in Table 6, QuickCross was successful in obtaining the conjectured optimum in all cases and for all scheme combinations, except \\(K_{30,30}\\) and \\(K_{40,40}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, authors of algorithms that deal with particular graph types might prefer to focus on collections with specific attributes, that might be attributes of the nodes, the edges or the entire graph.

It is a collection of graphs that represent movie plots, and the nodes are the characters in the movie. The edges represent the interactions between the characters. This dataset was initially collected by Yuzuru Tanahashi, then stored on his homepage at UC Davis, which, unfortunately, got taken down after some time from its publication. This caused the dataset to be lost for a period of time, as none of the papers that used it provided a link to the dataset or stored it as part of their supplemental material. The experiments contained in such papers were then rendered non-reproducible because of the missing dataset. Through the help of personal connections at UC Davis, we were luckily able to recover the dataset.\n\nOriginally found at: UC Davis’ website, personal page which is now unavailable.

These interactions between characters can be separated into a series of interaction sessions, each session representing the time span of a set of interacting characters. More precisely, we define an interaction session as a unit which holds three attributes: • initiation time, • duration, and • members. Initiation time corresponds to the time when the interaction session begins. Duration corresponds to the duration of the interaction session. Members corresponds to the set of characters involved in the interaction session. Each interaction session represents a time slot in the data where its members are interacting. Note that any change in the formation of members (e.g., a character leaving or joining) indicates a separate interaction session.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “An Efficient Framework for Generating Storyline Visualizations from Streaming Data”:\n\n\n\nFrom “StoryFlow: Tracking the Evolution of Stories”:\n\n\n\nFrom “Crossing Minimization in Storyline Visualizations”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilitarized Interstate Disputes (MID)\n\n\n\n\n\nCollected as part of the Correlates Of War project, the dataset contains two disconnected Temporal event sequences\n\nOriginally found at: https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/MIDs/\n\n\n\nDownload formatted data:  GEXF GML GRAPHML JSON\n\n\n\nSize: The dataset consists of 2 disconnected temporal event sequence graphs, one with 11,766 nodes and 5,883 edges, and the other with 9,619 nodes and 8,017 edges.\n\n\n\nOrigin paper: \n\n\n\n(Palmer et al. 2022)\n\n\nThe MID5 Dataset, 2011–2014: Procedures, coding rules, and description.\n\n\n\n\nUsage examples: \n\n\n\n(Y.

Fig. 6 is the result of reproducing the KEGG overview pathway map using our approach. The color coding of the category here is directly retrieved from the original KEGG database [43], as similarly incorporated in Metabopolis [64] (see figures in supplementary materials, available online). We also set the same threshold for specifying unimportant vertices as in Metabopolis, so that readers can refer to the paper for comparison (Fig. 6). The advantage of this technique allows us to arrange the vertexts in a balanced fashion by pushing vertexts away from each other. This initially gives users an idea of how big each category is, and explicitly shows which reaction is classified under which category. Users can also identify sub-components effectively since those components with identical topological structures are aligned as neighbors. This also helps users to comprehend which structures are associated with certain types of pathways, such as small chains, stars, etc.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “Multi-Level Area Balancing of Clustered Graphs”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-Phylogenetic Trees\n\n\n\n\n\nCollected by the authors of “https://almob.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13015-014-0031-3.

The REALGRAPHS set includes the 5 largest real-world graphs (mainly scale-free graphs) used in the experimental study of GILA [5]. These graphs are taken from the Stanford Large Networks Dataset Collection [3] and from the Network Data Repository [46], and their number of edges is between 121523 and 1541514.\n\nFrom “Drawing Big Graphs Using Spectral Sparsification”:\n\nWe used three data sets. The first set of graphs is taken from “defacto-benchmark” graphs, including the Hachul library, Walshaw’s Graph Partitioning Archive, the sparse matrices collection [6] and the network repository [24]. These include two types of graphs that have been extensively studied in graph drawing research: grid-like graphs and scale-free graphs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPajek\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pajek Program for Large Network Analysis is a tool developed and hosted by Andrej Vlado and some of their colleagues. As part of this program, they later compiled relevant graphs and links to other datasets, which we call today the Pajek collection. As a curiosity, pajek means spider in Slovenian. Many of Pajek graphs have been included as part of the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection.\n\nOriginally found at: http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/\n\n\n\nOrigin paper: \n\n\n\n(Batagelj and Mrvar 2006)\n\n\nPajek datasets\n\n\n\n\nUsage examples: \n\n\n\n(Noack 2004)\n\n\nEnergy Models for Graph Clustering\n\n\nClusters (generated)Generic\n\n\n\n\n(Meidiana et al. 2019)\n\n\nA Quality Metric for Visualization of Clusters in Graphs\n\n\nClusters (generated)\n\n\n\n\nDescriptions from Literature\nFrom “Energy Models for Graph Clustering”:\n\nAirline Routing (Figure 5): The nodes of this graph represent US airports, and the (unweighted) edges represent direct flights. The probability that two airports are connected by a direct flight is strongly related to their geographical distance: Most direct flights are relatively short, and only few large hub airports are connected by direct long-range flights. The distances in the edge-repulsion LinLog layout resemble the relative geographical distances of the airports remarkably closely, given that the graph does not contain any explicit information about geographical distances.\n\n\nDictionary (Figure 7): The nodes represent terms in the Online Dictionary of Library and Information Science (ODLIS), and the edges represent hyperlinks. A hyperlink between two terms exists if one term is used to describe the meaning of the other term, and thus connects semantically related terms. The edge-repulsion LinLog layout indeed groups semantically related terms, which is better reflected in the VRML file on the supplementary web page than in Figure 7(c). Such a grouping is useful, for example, for discovering the global topic areas (like publishing, printing, information technology, etc.), for identifying entry points for the exploration of topics, or for finding semantically related terms even if they are not explicitly linked.\n\nFrom “A Quality Metric for Visualization of Clusters in Graphs”:\n\nWe re-used some datasets from the validation experiments and created some new ones, listed in Table 2. We also selected real world graph datasets with existing vertex categorization, which are listed under the double line in Table 2. The datasets were taken from Pajek [2] and Stanford Network Analysis Project’s (SNAP) repository [23, 40].\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “Energy Models for Graph Clustering”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNAP (Stanford Network Analysis Platform)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SNAP repository is a collection of datasets assembled as part of the Stanford Network Analysis Platform, which started in 2004 and launched their website in 2009. Well-known, widely used graph repository. A number of graphs that became relevant individually are included in SNAP, such as Enron, Amazon, Protein Interactions datasets and various Social Network graphs. SNAP contains Genericgraphs, directedand Undirectedgraphs, Dynamicgraphs and more.

The resulting test-bed is made of eight chapters, seven pairs of chapters, six triples of chapters and five quadruples of chapters from “Anna Karenina”, and five chapters, four pairs of chapters and three triples of chapters from “Les Mis ́erables”, plus the entire “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”, “Inception-sf”, “Inception”, “Star Wars”, “The Matrix-sf”, and “The Matrix”.\n\nFrom “Anisotropic Radial Layout for Visualizing Centrality and Structure in Graphs”:\n\nThe third dataset is a graph of character associations in the famous French novel Les Miserables (Fig. 5) [18]. This graph consists of 77 nodes, each representing a character in the novel, and 254 weighted edges where the weights represent the number of chapters that feature both characters associated with an edge. We see the that the main protagonist Valjean (marked in red) is placed prominently in all three visualizations (Fig. 5). However, other key characters in the plot such as Inspector Javert (blue) and Cosett (orange), who do not appear often with characters other than the protagonist (and thus have low betweenness centrality) are treated differently. While the radial layout relegates them to the periphery (far from Valjean) (Fig. 5b), MDS (Fig. 5a) paints a conflicting picture with regard to their centrality, e.g., Cosett’s node almost overlaps with Valjean despite its low centrality. In contrast, the proposed ARL (Fig.5c) is able to coherently convey the low centrality of the Inspector Javert and Cosett, as well as, their closeness to Valjean. The above issue of distance distortion appears to be a frequent occurrence in the radial layout due to many characters who have a low centrality value causing them to end up being packed in the outer periphery. A case of contrast is that of the character Bishop Myriel (green) who despite being associated with several characters, is only seen with Valjean once.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “Crossing Minimization in Storyline Visualizations”:\n\n\n\nFrom “Graph Layouts by t-SNE”:\n\n\n\nlesmis is the GraphBase Les Miserables graph\nFrom “Anisotropic Radial Layout for Visualizing Centrality and Structure in Graphs”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuiteSparse Matrix Collection\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SuiteSparse Matrix Collection, formerly known as the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection, is a comprehensive repository of 2893 sparse matrices. All graphs in SuiteSparse belong to groups which will have more information about the graphs and the sub-collections they belong to. In our Descriptions from the Literature section we also highlight a few tables with the specific graphs used in a couple of papers. From “The university of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection”, Davis and Hu describe the origin of this network repository. Namely they cite the Harwell-Boeing collection as the starting point for SuiteSparse, then called the University of Florida (UF) Sparse matrix collection, back in 1991. Other groups, or collections, have then been added to SuitseSparse through the years, mainly focusing on real-world matrices and other relevant problems related to them.\n\nOriginally found at: https://sparse.tamu.edu/\n\n\n\nSize: 2893\n\n\n\nOrigin paper: \n\n\n\n(Davis and Hu 2011)\n\n\nThe University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection\n\n\n\n\nUsage examples: \n\n\n\n(E.

We selected these graphs as they differ in their structure and size, and are large enough to compare the results of different techniques. Two of the graphs, LeHavre and commanche, have predefined edge lengths that were derived from the node coordinates. We did not modify the graphs in any way, except for those that were disconnected, in which case we only kept the largest component.\n\n\n\n\nFrom “A Maxent-Stress Model for Graph Layout”:\n\nWith the exception of graph gd, which is an author collaboration graph of the International Symposium on Graph Drawing between 1994 and 2007, the graphs used are from the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection [9]. Our selection covers a range of graph sizes, and includes mesh-like and other nonmesh graphs, and graphs from Brandes and Pich’s experimental study of distance scaling [5].\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.

In addition there is a 3D semi-structured graph, cti, which is unstructured in the x−y plane but extended regularly along the z-axis. Finally the test suite includes three non mesh-based graphs (add32, vibrobox, bcsstk32) which arise from various scientific computing applications2. None of the graphs have either vertex or edge weights; such graphs are not widely available since most applications do not accurately instrument costs and it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from the few examples that we have access to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “An Experimental Comparison of Fast Algorithms for Drawing General Large Graphs”:\n\n\n\nFrom “Multi-Level Graph Layout on the GPU”:\n\n\n\nFig. 11. 4elt.

The original graph and samples obtained by RDN, SST, MCGS are shown in Figure 5.\n\nFrom “Graphs over time: densification laws, shrinking diameters and possible explanations”\n\nThe graph of routers comprising the Internet can be organized into sub-graphs called Autonomous Systems (AS). Each AS exchanges traffic flows with some neighbors (peers). We can construct a communication network of who-talks-towhom from the BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) logs. We use the the Autonomous Systems (AS) dataset from [26]. The dataset contains 735 daily instances which span an interval of 785 days from November 8 1997 to January 2 2000.In contrast to citation networks, where nodes and edges only get added (not deleted) over time, the AS dataset also exhibits both the addition and deletion of the nodes and edges over time.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “Preserving Minority Structures in Graph Sampling”\n\n\n\nFig. 5.

SNAP asks to cite the paper linked in Origin paper. Very high variance in node degrees. Data can be considered threaded and directed, although SNAP provides a version of the network that is explicitly undirected.

Because of geographical closeness and free trade agreements, countries on the same continent trade more intensively than countries on different continents. Figure 1 shows the minimum energy layouts of the trade graph for the three force and energy models. The layout of the widely used Fruchterman-Reingold model [20] does not show any clear groups at all.

Instead of collecting each of these individual, contextual datasets, we aggregated them into subcategories called Aggregate collections. These collections group together datasets from the same real-life context, which may have multiple sources. Real-life contexts are distinguishable by specific properties or requirements found in graphs from those sources; for instance, collaboration networks can be represented as hypergraphs, while air traffic routes have nodes (airports) with fixed spatial coordinates and numerous edges connecting the nodes, making them suitable for edge bundling algorithms. Individual information about each aggregate collection can be found in the papers that contain them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssorted Collaboration Network\n\n\n\n\n\nContains IEEEVis Publication Data, DBLP collaborations, and CPAN, which contains collaboration information among developers using Perl.

Through a query consisting of keywords and Boolean operators, one can retrieve a set of publications on a desired topic. We use the results returned by DBLP to construct networks where nodes are authors and edges indicate co-authorships, weighted by the number of papers shared by their end-nodes. Nodes are labeled with authors’ names and edges with the titles of the corresponding publications. We performed the query “network AND visualization” and limited to 500 the number of search results (i.e., publications) to be returned. The resulting network consists of 1766 nodes, 3780 edges, and 382 connected components. The largest of these components contains 118 nodes and 322 edges.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom Parallel Edge Splatting for Scalable dynamic Graph Visualization\n\n\n\nFig. 8.

Note that in all images here generated with our method, we used simple additive edge blending only, as our focus here is the layout, not the rendering. Images (a,b) show an air traffic graph (nodes are city locations, edges are interconnecting flights)… Images (e-h) show the US migrations graph bundled with the WR, GBEB, FDEB, and our method (SBEB) respectively. Overall, SBEB produces stronger bundling, due to the many iterations I = 10 being used), and emphasizes the structure of connections between groups of close cities (due to the skeleton layout cues). If less bundling is desired, fewer iterations can be used (Fig. 4). Adjusting the postprocessing smoothing and relaxation parameters, SBEB can create bundling styles similar to either GBEB (higher bundle curvatures, more emphasis on the graph structure) or FDEB (smoother bundles). Finally, images (i,j) show the US airlines graph bundled with the FDEB and SBEB respectively. SBEB generates stronger bundling (more overdraw) but arguably less clutter. Note also that SBEB generates treelike bundle structures which is useful when the exploration task at hand has an inherent (local) hierarchical nature, e.g. see how traffic connections merge into and/or split from main traffic routes.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “Edge-Path Bundling: A Less Ambiguous Edge Bundling Approach”:\n\n\n\nFig. 1. Edge bundling of the migrations dataset. (a) Straight line drawing. (b) Force-directed edge bundling aggregates edges well, but overaggregates at the centre of the drawing making it difficult to see patterns in the east-west flow (red bundle). (c) Cubu has a similar drawback at the centre of the map to a lesser degree. (d) Winding roads divides this structure into several smaller flows, but they may not be necessarily related to graph structure. (e) Edge-path bundling is able to distinguish between several flows that reflect paths in the underlying graph. (f) When edge direction is considered, the algorithm is able to further subdivide these flows based on direction.\n\n\n\nFig. 8. Airlines (undirected). (a) Input drawing. (b) Force-directed bundling is able to cluster edges into the major flows, but some overaggregation prevents details from being visualised. (c) Cubu provides a good bundling, but also has overaggregation. (c) Confluent drawings can be imposed on the layout, but as the approach cannot layout the graph bicliques can be distantly located, resulting in suboptimal performance. (e) Winding roads divides the flows into many streams, but these streams can be unfaithful to graph structure. (f) Edge-path bundling aggregates edges using weighted paths. The four prominent bundle intersections on the east coast correspond to major airports: Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis, and Dallas.\n\n\n\nFig. 10. Results of four algorithms on the air traffic network. (a) Force-directed bundling is able to recover the major trajectories but does not strongly bundle the network. (b) Cubu strongly bundles the main flows of airtraffic, but can suffer from overaggregation. (c) Winding roads divides the traffic into many smaller bundles, but this may not be reflective of underlying graph structure. (d) With edge-path bundling, each bundle necessarily reflects a path in the network. There are separate flows across the atlantic and asia that correspond to paths through the network.\nFrom “Skeleton-Based Edge Bundling for Graph Visualization”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Dependency Graphs\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious software call dependency graphs have been used in the literature.

The package and class structure provides a natural hierarchy on the methods of the system. The resulting dynamic graph consists of 2,817 vertices connected by 15,339 edges, where each edge is weighted by 1.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom Parallel Edge Splatting for Scalable Dynamic Graph Visualization:\n\n\n\nFig. 6.

Three hierarchy levels – layers, units, and modules – consisting of 284 nodes are used together with the associated call graph for the elements at the lowest level of the hierarchy, i.e., 1,011 adjacency relations representing module-to-module calls.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “Hierarchical Edge Bundles: Visualization of Adjacency Relations in Hierarchical Data”:\n\n\n\nFig. 13. A software system and its associated call graph (caller = green, callee = red). (a) and (b) show the system with bundling strength β = 0.85 using a balloon layout (node labels disabled) and a radial layout, respectively. Bundling reduces visual clutter, making it easier to perceive the actual connections than when compared to the non-bundled versions (figures 2a and 11a). Bundled visualizations also show relations between sparsely connected systems more clearly (encircled regions); these are almost completely obscured in the non-bundled versions. The encircled regions highlight identical parts of the system for (a), (b), and figure 15.\n\n\nSubversion Control Logs (Lost)\nFrom “An Efficient Framework for Generating Storyline Visualizations from Streaming Data”:\n\nThe datasets we used for this study were: … Python Subversion Control Logs (Python) [30] Eclipse Subversion Control Logs (Eclipse) [30] … These datasets all contained temporal logs of events in which entities interact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogposts, Tweets, and Forums\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the surveyed papers we found various instances of blogposts, tweets, and forum posts.

This graph contains 34 nodes, each representing an individual, and 78 unweighted edges that represent a friendship between the associated individuals (Fig. 1). During the period of observation, a conflict between two key members, identified as the “administrator” and “instructor”, leads to a split in the club, giving it an interesting two cluster structure. In Fig. 1, nodes representing members who are part of the instructor’s and administrator’s groups are drawn in green and blue, respectively.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “The Turing Test for Graph Drawing Algorithms”:\n\n\n\nFigure from supplementary materials using a force directed layout.\nFrom “Anisotropic Radial Layout for Visualizing Centrality and Structure in Graphs”:\n\n\n\nFig. 1.

The network size varies from 762 to 41K vertices and from 16K to 1.6M edges. Thedataset is directly from Facebook, not sampled, and thus very complete in terms of capturing the social relations according to a widely used service at that time. Additional attributes obtained from the Facebook profiles are gender, expected year of graduation, dormitory, etc. Due to incomplete profiles, a number of attribute values are missing.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom Untangling the Hairballs of Multi-Centered, Small-World Online Social Media Networks\nFig. 1. Facebook friendships at California Institute of Technology (Caltech36). Vertex color corresponds to dormitory (gray for missing values), but has not been utilized by the layout algorithm. The layout in (a) is based on the entire graph, whereas (b)-(f) use edge embeddedness, which spreads the graph while keeping cohesive groups together. Embeddedness mapped to edge color; backbone edges dark gray.\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Ego Networks (Facebook 1864)\n\n\nDescription from Literature\nFrom ****Preserving Minority Structures in Graph Sampling\n\nThe Facebook1684 graph data set is an online social network with 775 nodes and 14,006 edges. The original graph and six samples are shown in Figure 4. This data set is an unbalanced graph in which two large communities include 705 nodes and two small communities/cliques contain only 70 nodes.\n\nThe supplemental material for *****Network Alignment by Discrete Ollivier-Ricci Flow* also provides user 1864 of the Facebook ego networks in their repository.\nFrom A Random Sampling O(n) Force-calculation Algorithm for Graph Layouts:\n\nThe ego graphs are Facebook ego graphs [ML12] with the ego vertex re-added to the graph.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom Preserving Minority Structures in Graph Sampling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222065)\n\n\n\nFig. 4. Interface for subjective assessment experiment with the Facebook1684 data set (775 nodes and 14,006 edges). The leftmost graph is the original graph. The six randomly arranged samples are generated by SST (a), FF (b), MCGS (c), RW (d), TIES (e), and RDN (f) with a sampling rate of 30%.\n\n\nVan De Bunt Fraternity\n\n\nDescription from the Literature\nFrom Preserving Minority Structures in Graph Sampling\n\nVan De Bunt (Discrete): shows the relationships between 32 freshmen at seven different time points. A discrete dynamic graph is built using the method of Brandes et al.  [9], with an undirected edge inserted into a timeslice if the participants reciprocally report “best friendship” or “friendship” at that time.\n\n\n\nSyphilis Social Network\n\n\nDescription from the Literature\nFrom SetCoLa: High-Level Constraints for Graph Layout:\n\nSocial networks can be a powerful way to understand inter-personal relationships and are useful for tracking the spread of diseases that result from personal contact [RST*98, FHH*01, MRV*03, FHD*11]. The ability to track and identify at risk individuals can lead to treatment and help manage the spread of the disease. In addition to the links between individuals, structuring the layout by node properties such as the social or ethnographically-identified group may reveal additional details about how the disease is spread.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom SetCoLa: High-Level Constraints for Graph Layout:\n\n\n\nFig. 4. The layout for the syphilis social network from (a) Rothenberg et al. [RST*98]. (b) We recreated and improved the layout in SetCoLa by introducing additional padding, alignment, and circle constraints to further highlight the relative number of interactions among the different groups. For both figures, the nodes are split into three groups, from left to right: young affluent white men, younger white women, and young African-American men. Individuals not associated with any of these “core” groups are positioned above the others. In both figures, individuals diagnosed with syphilis during the outbreak are labeled with an “S” on the node label.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransportation Networks\n\n\n\n\n\nTransportation networks are interesting because of their Spatialnature, and feautre Directed edges DIMACS USA Road Network source notes that the data has errors, namely missing major highways and bridges.

These networks have not been used as examples for previous metro map layout methods, so we can compare only against the official maps of Vienna and London. The size of the metro graphs (including Sydney) is given in Table 3 and ranges from 84 vertices and 8 faces (Vienna) to 308 vertices and 55 faces (London). The table further shows how the removal of degree-2 vertices described in Section 5.1 effectively reduces the number of vertices and edges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “Drawing and Labeling High-Quality Metro Maps by Mixed-Integer Programming”:\n\n\n\nFig. 16.

A dataset that is not accessible anymore renders all the papers using it unfortunately not reproducible. Most of the instances we found became lost because of lack of maintenance of the original storage locations: websites, servers, or repositories. This is, unfortunately, a significant issue in science, which is now hopefully gaining more attention.\n“Loss” of a dataset does not exclusively mean that the entire, original dataset became lost, but also that a paper using a dataset with particular edits—such as interpreting a debate as a graph between the participants—has not documented well enough their process and did not link to the edited dataset. This makes it impossible to reproduce the results of the paper, and is further discussed in Section 4.1.6.\nWhile we did go through the effort, for each one of them, to recover them and store them on OSF, we could not find anywhere the following list of datasets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGION\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data was originally collected for a Bioinformatics paper, Graph-based clustering and characterization of repetitive sequences in next-generation sequencing data.

To understand whether the experimental results are influenced by the structure of the graph we considered several graph families. All graphs are of small or medium size, expressed as the number of their vertices. In some cases, the size and the number of instances used for each graph family depends on the type of question we want to answer (see Sect. 5 for details). We used the following datasets: Trees. Generated with uniform probability distribution using Pru ̈fer sequences [28]. Planar. Connected simple planar graphs, generated with the OGDF library [6]. General. Connected simple graphs, generated with uniform probability distribution. Scale-free. Scale-free graphs, generated according to the Barabasi-Albert model [2]. Caterpillars. Each caterpillar of n vertices is generated by first creating a path (spine of the caterpillar) of length \\(k\\in [ \\frac{n}{4} , \\frac{n}{2} ]\\) (randomly chosen), and attaching each remaining vertex to a randomly selected vertex of the spine. Paths, Cycles. For each desired number of vertices n, there is only one (unlabeled) path and one (unlabeled) cycle of n vertices. k-ary Trees. Rooted trees where each node has either 0 or k children. Each tree is generated by starting with a single vertex and then creating k children of a randomly selected leaf, until the desired number n of vertices is achieved. When n cannot be obtained, we use a value close to it.\n\nFrom “An Interactive Tool to Explore and Improve the Ply Number of Drawings”:\n\nFM3data contains 50 caterpillars with 250 to 450 vertices… FM3data also contains planar graphs ranging from 250 to 400 vertices and a density ranging from 1.5 to 2… The remaining subset of FM3data consists of general graphs with 250 to 450 vertices and the densities 1.5 and 2.5.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “An Experimental Study on the Ply Number of Straight-Line Drawings”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPadia Stories\n\n\n\n\n\nThese consist of fabricated narratives for characters of popular culture franchises, namely “The Witcher” and “Friends”.

In our example narrative, the hero, Geralt of Rivia needs to rescue his friend, Triss Merigold, who has mysteriously disappeared. On his journey to find her he must first determine where she was seen last, talk to multiple friends, and resolve a conflict between a troll couple before he can meet her. There are two choice points in this narrative: first, Margot can either choose to help Geralt or refuse to provide help; second, the troll couple can either accept or reject Geralt’s solution to their conflict. Each of these choices affects the outcome of the narrative creating three possible timelines. The first timeline contains events favorable to Geralt. In this timeline, Margot agrees to help Geralt and the troll couple accept Geralt’s solution leading him to find Triss. Fig. 5 shows a visualization of this outcome as the reality timeline for our narrative. We can see that Geralt was able to successfully track Triss’s last known location, gather information from friends, resolve a conflict between the trolls, and meet Triss. Note that in this visualization we are showing the default, reality timeline and all links are drawn with 100% opacity. We can also observe all single-entity events in the narrative in this visualization. In the second timeline, the trolls reject Geralt’s solution to their conflict. Fig. 6 shows a visualization of this unfavorable outcome as diegetic timeline overlaid on top of the reality timeline. While most of the events are same in both timelines, the diegetic timeline ends at the event “Speak to She-Troll.” The reduced opacity of the reality timeline allows the user to compare common sections of the two timelines, even when one of them is smaller than the other. In the third timeline, Margot refuses to help Geralt preventing him from progressing further on his quest. This is the shortest timeline in our narrative.\n\nFrom ’’Yarn: Generating Storyline Visualizations Using HTN Planning”:\n\nFor our second example we use a fictional narrative scenario based on the popular sitcom Friends. In this narrative, Ross’s plan is to take Rachel on a date. To do so, he must acquire more information about her, find some way of talking to her, ensure she is positively disposed towards him, and eventually ask her out. He can acquire more information about her in a number of ways including calling her mother, or asking Phoebe about her by either call or text. To ensure she is in a positive mood, he can either give her a gift or say nice things to her, and finally he can either ask her out himself or ask for Phoebe’s help. To illustrate causality of events in the narrative timeline, we have set up the operator functions for Rachel such that she is more inclined to say yes to Ross if he talks to her mother rather than requesting Phoebe’s help. Additionally, Rachel’s probability of accepting Ross’s proposal is also dependent on how impressed she is by him when he asks her. There are four choice points in this narrative: three for Ross, and one for Rachel. The choices made by Ross create 12 alternate timelines, each illustrating a different way in which he can ask Rachel out. Towards the end of each timeline Rachel can decide to either reply yes to Ross, or reply no, creating a total of 24 timelines. Fig. 7 shows a visualization where Rachel agrees to go out with Ross in both timelines. While the timelines result in the same outcome, and visually look the same, we can inspect the labels on top of the events in Ross’s timeline to identify the differences. Lighter labels correspond to the reality timeline, while darker labels correspond to the diegetic timeline. In the reality timeline, Ross decided to give a gift to Rachel after talking to her mom, while in the diegetic timeline he decided to act friendly with her. Fig. 8 shows another visualization for the same narrative. In this example we can see the effect of causal conditions set in the operator functions for Rachel. In the reality timeline, Rachel decided not to go out with Ross because he asked Phoebe for help by messaging her. On the other hand, she agreed to go out with him in the diegetic timeline because in this case Ross decided to talk to her mother.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom ’’Yarn: Generating Storyline Visualizations Using HTN Planning”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternet Mapping Project\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original Internet Mapping Project started at Bell lab in 1998.

The edges of G are directed edges. An edge (u,v) can model different types of relationships between u and v.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom CHORDLINK: A New Hybrid Visualization Model\n\n\n\nFig. 4.

While this data is not quite a tree (or even connected, or planar), we extract a subset to create a tree with 500 nodes. The maximum node degree of this tree is 5 and the radius is 14.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom The Mathematics Genealogy Project:\n\n\n\nFrom “Visualizing Evolving Trees”:\n\n\n\nFig. 4: Layouts from DynNoSlice, DynaGraph, Dagre, Radial, ImPrEd, DynaCola and DynaSafe of the same evolving math genealogy tree; each row adds six new nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom-made Datasets\nIn the data we collected, we also found several instances of custom-made datasets. We consider custom-made datasets either edits to pre-existing datasets, where the authors found it necessary to either split or modify the dataset in a particular way, or datasets completely made up from scratch using random generators or custom-made code. This can happen in cases where the authors of a paper needed a dataset containing particular characteristics which was not easy to find in the wild, so a new dataset was crafted.\nFor instance, consider the case where the authors of a paper develop an algorithm that works on hypergraphs. They want to test that the algorithm works, and test its performance on hypergraphs of various sizes, but datasets containing hypergraphs are difficult to find. For this reason, the authors craft one dataset synthetically, or take a pre-existing dataset and edit it so that it now contains hyperedges.\nWe split custom-made datasets in three categories, with their occurrences in the corpus of papers illustrated below:\n\n{ \n  let d = []\n  \n  let allbenchmarkdatasets = [...new Set(literature.map(l =&gt; l[\"Dataset tag clean\"].split(\",\").map(d =&gt; d.trim())).flat())].filter(a =&gt; a != \"\")\n\n  for (let dataset of allbenchmarkdatasets){\n    if (!dataset.includes(\"Custom\")) continue;\n    let literature_entries_with_this_dataset = literature.filter(l =&gt; l[\"Dataset tag clean\"].includes(dataset))\n\n    d.push({\"dataset\": dataset, \"count\": literature_entries_with_this_dataset.length})\n  }\n  \n  return Plot.plot({\n    color: {\n      // legend: true,\n      type: \"categorical\",\n      // domain: d3.range(10).map((d, i) =&gt; `Category ${i + 1}`),\n      scheme: \"Tableau10\" // use the \"accent\" scheme\n    },\n    y: {\n      // tickFormat: \"s\"\n    },\n    marks: [\n      Plot.barX(d, {x: \"count\", y: \"dataset\", fill: \"dataset\",inset: 2, sort: {y: \"x\", reverse: true}}),\n      Plot.axisY({label: null, lineWidth: 12, marginLeft: 150}),\n    ]\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: The chart shows what type of edits were made to datasets, or how they were generated. Non-Replicable edits or generation of datasets where the majority in the corpus of papers we collected.\n\n\n\n\nReplicable datasets indicate cases where the authors have given enough information so that the experiment can be replicated exactly as it was run by the authors of a paper, or closely enough that the results obtained reflect the published ones very closely. This includes cases where either the authors published the entire dataset they used, they published the code they used to generate the dataset, or include an exact description of the steps they took to generate it.\nReproducible datasets are cases where the authors described the steps they took to generate and/or edit their datasets, but not in-depth enough so that the exact same graphs can be reproduced, and did not redistribute it. Results can still be reproduces somewhat closely if the authors took care to report enough information about their graphs.\nFor non-replicable datasets, we indicate cases where the authors did not distribute their datasets and did not include enough information in the paper so that their results could be replicated.\nThis information is closely tied to the distribution of supplemental material in papers, that is shown in the chart below:\n\n{ \n  let d = []\n  \n  let allbenchmarkdatasets = [...new Set(literature.map(l =&gt; l[\"Supplemental material (Multi-select)\"].split(\",\").map(d =&gt; d.trim())).flat())].filter(a =&gt; a != \"\")\n\n  for (let dataset of allbenchmarkdatasets){\n    let literature_entries_with_this_dataset = literature.filter(l =&gt; l[\"Supplemental material (Multi-select)\"].includes(dataset))\n\n    if (dataset == \"Yes\") continue;\n    // capitalize first letter\n    dataset = dataset.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + dataset.slice(1)\n\n    d.push({\"dataset\": dataset, \"count\": literature_entries_with_this_dataset.length})\n  }\n  \n  return Plot.plot({\n    color: {\n      // legend: true,\n      type: \"categorical\",\n      // domain: d3.range(10).map((d, i) =&gt; `Category ${i + 1}`),\n      scheme: \"Tableau10\" // use the \"accent\" scheme\n    },\n    y: {\n      // tickFormat: \"s\"\n    },\n    marks: [\n      Plot.barX(d, {x: \"count\", y: \"dataset\", fill: \"dataset\",inset: 2, sort: {y: \"x\", reverse: true}}),\n      Plot.axisY({label: null, lineWidth: 12, marginLeft: 150}),\n    ]\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: What is distributed as supplemental material with papers? Most papers just distribute an extended version of their content, while another large chunk in our analysis did not distribute any.\n\n\n\n\nThis discussion is part of a larger discourse on research replicability, that is gaining traction in the scientific community. The ACM, for instance, has a policy on artifact review and badging, where authors are encouraged to submit their artifacts for review, and if they pass, they receive a badge that indicates the artifact is available for review. This is a step towards making research more replicable and reproducible, and we hope that our work will contribute to this effort.\nSee, e.g., ACM’s definitions at https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current."

    "text": "4.2 Random generation\nWe discussed above that in a few cases, authors have generated their own datasets to test their algorithms. We call these generated datasets synthetic or custom, as opposed to datasets found in the wild. Generating a synthetic dataset can be essential for several reasons, particularly in the context of algorithm development and validation:\n\nPrivacy and Publication Constraints: Imagine you’ve created an innovative algorithm using a dataset that, due to privacy concerns, cannot be shared publicly. To validate and share your work without compromising data confidentiality, creating a synthetic dataset that mirrors the essential features of the original data allows you to showcase your algorithm’s effectiveness while adhering to privacy restrictions.\nBenchmarking and Comparative Analysis: Suppose you have access to a single dataset that can be shared and wish to prove your algorithm’s robustness across various scenarios. Generating synthetic datasets with comparable characteristics provides a controlled environment to conduct benchmark studies. This approach enables scientists to demonstrate that your algorithm performs consistently well across datasets with analogous features, thereby reinforcing its applicability and reliability.\nAddressing Data Availability Issues: In certain situations, you might design an algorithm to process graphs with specific attributes only to discover the absence of publicly available datasets showcasing these features. Synthetic datasets become invaluable here, allowing you to create tailored data that incorporates the necessary characteristics. This approach not only facilitates the testing of your algorithm in a relevant context but also helps in illustrating its potential in hypothetical yet plausible scenarios.\n\nWe use the word synthetic too in cases where the dataset has been altered, sliced, or other modifications have been applied to it.\nThe following is a practical example of a case where you would need to edit a network:\n\nImagine you are building a visualization to deal with the entirety of the Enron Corpus dataset , which has hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges. Because of its size, you decide to slice up the large dataset in many smaller files, so you can run tests. This particular dataset, in addition to being a challenging problem because of its size, also has an interesting distribution of connection densities: some nodes are extremely well connected, while others are much less connected. Indeed, the dataset is comprised of a collection of emails sent by Enron executives - between themselves or between other employees of the company. Because of how the dataset is constructed - where only the emails from the executives are taken into account - it has a distinctive skew in the connectedness of the data: 158 nodes are extremely well connected, while the rest of the nodes are much less connected. Because of this, there’s uncountable mistakes that can be done through slicing this graph: for instance, slicing it so that the subset includes a less dense section of the entire graph will fail to provide a representative section.\n\nWhile the creation of a synthetic dataset is a perfectly viable way to produce a benchmark set, in addition to replicability criteria (as discussed above), we also have to pay particular attention to a number of statistics related to the structure of graphs — both when generating new datasets, and when slicing up existing datasets to reduce their size, or to create more graphs from a single, larger graph.\nComparing two synthetic graph collections meaningfully is not straightforward. Without shared generation procedures or metadata, it’s difficult to claim that they represent comparable input conditions for layout evaluation. A number of structural and contextual features may affect comparability — including, for example, graph size (nodes and edges), density, and distribution of components or motifs. Even small changes in these properties can have a significant impact on layout results.\nWhile a full discussion of all relevant factors is beyond the scope of this paper, we highlight this issue to caution against assuming that two synthetic datasets are interchangeable just because they were randomly generated. A more careful analysis of their structural characteristics is often necessary.\nThe generation of random graphs that accurately mimic specific features presents a complex challenge, that has been explored abundantly in the past, but has not resulted in a universal solution. Two examples of popular models used to generate synthetic datasets are the Erdős-Rényi (ER) Erdős, Rényi, et al. (1960) and the Barabási-Albert (BA) Barabási and Albert (1999) models, each one with their distinct focus and limitations:\nThe ER model excels in creating graphs with uniform edge distribution Erdős, Rényi, et al. (1960), ideal for testing an algorithm’s ability to evenly space nodes and reduce edge crossings. However, it falls short in replicating the complex, non-uniform connections seen in real-world networks, limiting its applicability to scenarios requiring simplicity and randomness. Conversely, the BA model produces scale-free networks with a few highly connected nodes Barabási and Albert (1999), reflecting the hierarchical structure of many natural and human-made systems. It challenges layout algorithms to effectively display these hubs without cluttering. The limitation here is its focus on growth and preferential attachment, which might not suit all types of networks, particularly those without clear hub structures.\nAs there is no universal solution for random graph generation, our recommendation is to try as much as possible to pay attention to research replicability criteria, such as redistributing the generated dataset as supplemental material in the paper."

Body\n\nDescriptions from Literature\nFrom “An Experimental Comparison of Fast Algorithms for Drawing General Large Graphs”:\n\nThe rest of the test graphs are taken from real-world applications. In particular, we selected graphs from the AT&T graph library [1], from C. Walshaw’s graph collection [20], and a graph that describes a social network of 2113 people that we obtained from C. Lipp.\n\nFrom “A Combined Evolutionary Search and Multilevel Optimisation Approach to Graph-Partitioning”:\n\nThe test graphs have been chosen to be a representative sample of small to medium scale real-life problems (mostly mesh-based) and include both 2D and 3D examples of nodal graphs (where the mesh nodes are partitioned) and dual graphs (where the mesh elements are partitioned). In addition there is a 3D semi-structured graph, cti, which is unstructured in the x−y plane but extended regularly along the z-axis. Finally the test suite includes three non mesh-based graphs (add32, vibrobox, bcsstk32) which arise from various scientific computing applications2. None of the graphs have either vertex or edge weights; such graphs are not widely available since most applications do not accurately instrument costs and it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from the few examples that we have access to.\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “An Experimental Comparison of Fast Algorithms for Drawing General Large Graphs”:\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFrom “Multi-Level Graph Layout on the GPU”:\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFig. 11. 4elt.

The network is provided by the IRV (Italian Revenue Agency) and refers to a portion of data for the fiscal year 2014, consisting of 174 subjects with high fiscal risk and 200 economic transactions between them [11].\n\nFrom “A visual analytics system to support tax evasion discovery”:\n\nThe data sources queried by the IRV officers are modeled in TaxNet as a unified network G. Each node v of G is a single taxpayer, which can be either an individual or a legal person, like a private company or a public institution. Many attributes are associated with v, including the type of economic activity, the geographic location and territorial scope, the declared income, the amount of VAT credits/debts and of VAT refunded/paid, and the amount of economic exchange within the European Union. The edges of G are directed edges. An edge (u,v) can model different types of relationships between u and v."

These networks have not been used as examples for previous metro map layout methods, so we can compare only against the official maps of Vienna and London. The size of the metro graphs (including Sydney) is given in Table 3 and ranges from 84 vertices and 8 faces (Vienna) to 308 vertices and 55 faces (London). The table further shows how the removal of degree-2 vertices described in Section 5.1 effectively reduces the number of vertices and edges.\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “Drawing and Labeling High-Quality Metro Maps by Mixed-Integer Programming”:\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFig. 16.

The dataset includes the thesis titles, students, advisors, dates, and number of descendants. The total number of nodes is around 260,000 and is continuously updated. While this data is not quite a tree (or even connected, or planar), we extract a subset to create a tree with 500 nodes. The maximum node degree of this tree is 5 and the radius is 14.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom The Mathematics Genealogy Project:\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFrom “Visualizing Evolving Trees”:\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFig. 4: Layouts from DynNoSlice, DynaGraph, Dagre, Radial, ImPrEd, DynaCola and DynaSafe of the same evolving math genealogy tree; each row adds six new nodes.\n== STOP RENDERING ==\nhttps://github.com/abureyanahmed/evolving_tree/tree/main/dataset\nThey make you request the data individually and in the linked form they have a note about not redistributing data:\nmgp-permission-agreement.pdf\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nreached out to them 5/18/2023\nIt is non-planar because multiple advisors can advise the same person or a person can have multiple advisors! Infact, there is a K3,3 in it\nIn July 2016, Cosmin Ionita and Pat Quillen of MathWorks used MATLAB to analyze the Math Genealogy Project graph. At the time, the genealogy graph contained 200,037 vertices. There were 7639 (3.8%) isolated vertices and 1962 components of size two (advisor-advisee pairs where we have no information about the advisor). The largest component of the genealogy graph contained 180,094 vertices, accounting for 90% of all vertices in the graph. The main component has 7323 root vertices (individuals with no advisor) and 137,155 leaves (mathematicians with no students), accounting for 76.2% of the vertices in this component. The next largest component sizes were 81, 50, 47, 34, 34, 33, 31, 31, and 30. For historical comparisonn, we also have data from June 2010, when Professor David Joyner of the United States Naval Academy asked for data from our database to analyze it as a graph. At the time, the genealogy graph had 142,688 vertices. Of these, 7,190 were isolated vertices (5% of the total). The largest component had 121,424 vertices (85% of the total number). The next largest component had 128 vertices. The next largest component sizes were 79, 61, 45, and 42. The most frequent size of a nontrivial component was 2; there were 1937 components of size 2. The component with 121,424 vertices had 4,639 root verticies, i.e., mathematicians for whom the advisor is currently unknown.\nThe Mathematics Genealogy Project graph is nonplanar. Thanks to Professor Ezra Brown of Virginia Tech for assisting in finding the subdivision of K3,3 depicted below. The green vertices form one color class and the yellow ones form the other. Interestingly, Gauß is the only vertex that needs to be connected by paths with more than one edge."

Fig. 6 is the result of reproducing the KEGG overview pathway map using our approach. The color coding of the category here is directly retrieved from the original KEGG database [43], as similarly incorporated in Metabopolis [64] (see figures in supplementary materials, available online). We also set the same threshold for specifying unimportant vertices as in Metabopolis, so that readers can refer to the paper for comparison (Fig. 6). The advantage of this technique allows us to arrange the vertexts in a balanced fashion by pushing vertexts away from each other. This initially gives users an idea of how big each category is, and explicitly shows which reaction is classified under which category. Users can also identify sub-components effectively since those components with identical topological structures are aligned as neighbors. This also helps users to comprehend which structures are associated with certain types of pathways, such as small chains, stars, etc.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “Multi-Level Area Balancing of Clustered Graphs”:\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-01-25 at 10.50.53 AM.png\n\n\n=== STOP RENDERING ===\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-01-25 at 10.52.55 AM.png\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled"

Note that in all images here generated with our method, we used simple additive edge blending only, as our focus here is the layout, not the rendering. Images (a,b) show an air traffic graph (nodes are city locations, edges are interconnecting flights)… Images (e-h) show the US migrations graph bundled with the WR, GBEB, FDEB, and our method (SBEB) respectively. Overall, SBEB produces stronger bundling, due to the many iterations I = 10 being used), and emphasizes the structure of connections between groups of close cities (due to the skeleton layout cues). If less bundling is desired, fewer iterations can be used (Fig. 4). Adjusting the postprocessing smoothing and relaxation parameters, SBEB can create bundling styles similar to either GBEB (higher bundle curvatures, more emphasis on the graph structure) or FDEB (smoother bundles). Finally, images (i,j) show the US airlines graph bundled with the FDEB and SBEB respectively. SBEB generates stronger bundling (more overdraw) but arguably less clutter. Note also that SBEB generates treelike bundle structures which is useful when the exploration task at hand has an inherent (local) hierarchical nature, e.g. see how traffic connections merge into and/or split from main traffic routes.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “Edge-Path Bundling: A Less Ambiguous Edge Bundling Approach”:\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFig. 1. Edge bundling of the migrations dataset. (a) Straight line drawing. (b) Force-directed edge bundling aggregates edges well, but overaggregates at the centre of the drawing making it difficult to see patterns in the east-west flow (red bundle). (c) Cubu has a similar drawback at the centre of the map to a lesser degree. (d) Winding roads divides this structure into several smaller flows, but they may not be necessarily related to graph structure. (e) Edge-path bundling is able to distinguish between several flows that reflect paths in the underlying graph. (f) When edge direction is considered, the algorithm is able to further subdivide these flows based on direction.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFig. 8. Airlines (undirected). (a) Input drawing. (b) Force-directed bundling is able to cluster edges into the major flows, but some overaggregation prevents details from being visualised. (c) Cubu provides a good bundling, but also has overaggregation. (c) Confluent drawings can be imposed on the layout, but as the approach cannot layout the graph bicliques can be distantly located, resulting in suboptimal performance. (e) Winding roads divides the flows into many streams, but these streams can be unfaithful to graph structure. (f) Edge-path bundling aggregates edges using weighted paths. The four prominent bundle intersections on the east coast correspond to major airports: Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis, and Dallas.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFig. 10. Results of four algorithms on the air traffic network. (a) Force-directed bundling is able to recover the major trajectories but does not strongly bundle the network. (b) Cubu strongly bundles the main flows of airtraffic, but can suffer from overaggregation. (c) Winding roads divides the traffic into many smaller bundles, but this may not be reflective of underlying graph structure. (d) With edge-path bundling, each bundle necessarily reflects a path in the network. There are separate flows across the atlantic and asia that correspond to paths through the network.\nFrom “Skeleton-Based Edge Bundling for Graph Visualization”:\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-08-14 at 3.42.37 PM.png\n\n\n== STOP RENDERING ==\ngd contest: http://www.research.att.com/conf/gd96/contest.html\nlook here: https://github.com/mwallinger-tu/edge-path-bundling/tree/master/data from Edge-Path Bundling: A Less Ambiguous Edge Bundling Approach"

The resulting test-bed is made of eight chapters, seven pairs of chapters, six triples of chapters and five quadruples of chapters from “Anna Karenina”, and five chapters, four pairs of chapters and three triples of chapters from “Les Mis ́erables”, plus the entire “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”, “Inception-sf”, “Inception”, “Star Wars”, “The Matrix-sf”, and “The Matrix”.\n\nFrom “Anisotropic Radial Layout for Visualizing Centrality and Structure in Graphs”:\n\nThe third dataset is a graph of character associations in the famous French novel Les Miserables (Fig. 5) [18]. This graph consists of 77 nodes, each representing a character in the novel, and 254 weighted edges where the weights represent the number of chapters that feature both characters associated with an edge. We see the that the main protagonist Valjean (marked in red) is placed prominently in all three visualizations (Fig. 5). However, other key characters in the plot such as Inspector Javert (blue) and Cosett (orange), who do not appear often with characters other than the protagonist (and thus have low betweenness centrality) are treated differently. While the radial layout relegates them to the periphery (far from Valjean) (Fig. 5b), MDS (Fig. 5a) paints a conflicting picture with regard to their centrality, e.g., Cosett’s node almost overlaps with Valjean despite its low centrality. In contrast, the proposed ARL (Fig.5c) is able to coherently convey the low centrality of the Inspector Javert and Cosett, as well as, their closeness to Valjean. The above issue of distance distortion appears to be a frequent occurrence in the radial layout due to many characters who have a low centrality value causing them to end up being packed in the outer periphery. A case of contrast is that of the character Bishop Myriel (green) who despite being associated with several characters, is only seen with Valjean once.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “Crossing Minimization in Storyline Visualizations”:\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-08-17 at 4.29.43 PM.png\n\n\nFrom “Graph Layouts by t-SNE”:\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-08-17 at 4.21.24 PM.png\n\n\nlesmis is the GraphBase Les Miserables graph\nFrom “Anisotropic Radial Layout for Visualizing Centrality and Structure in Graphs”:\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-08-17 at 4.23.56 PM.png"

This graph contains 34 nodes, each representing an individual, and 78 unweighted edges that represent a friendship between the associated individuals (Fig. 1). During the period of observation, a conflict between two key members, identified as the “administrator” and “instructor”, leads to a split in the club, giving it an interesting two cluster structure. In Fig. 1, nodes representing members who are part of the instructor’s and administrator’s groups are drawn in green and blue, respectively.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “The Turing Test for Graph Drawing Algorithms”:\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFigure from supplementary materials using a force directed layout.\nFrom “Anisotropic Radial Layout for Visualizing Centrality and Structure in Graphs”:\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFig. 1.

If multiple contacts are active in a given interval, you will see multiple lines starting with the same value of t.

The nodes of the graph correspond to the countries, and the edge weights specify the trade volume between each pair of countries. Because of geographical closeness and free trade agreements, countries on the same continent trade more intensively than countries on different continents. Figure 1 shows the minimum energy layouts of the trade graph for the three force and energy models. The layout of the widely used Fruchterman-Reingold model [20] does not show any clear groups at all. The layout of the node-repulsion LinLog energy model groups the countries (nodes) primarily according to their total trade volume (degree). Only the layout of the edge-repulsion LinLog energy model shows the expected grouping according to continents.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “Untangling the Hairballs of Multi-Centered Small-World Online Social Media Networks”:\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-08-17 at 5.17.54 PM.png\n\n\nFrom “Energy Models for Graph Clustering”:\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-08-17 at 5.13.41 PM.png\n\n\n=== STOP RENDERING ===\nworld bank: www.worldbank.org"

These interactions between characters can be separated into a series of interaction sessions, each session representing the time span of a set of interacting characters. More precisely, we define an interaction session as a unit which holds three attributes: • initiation time, • duration, and • members. Initiation time corresponds to the time when the interaction session begins. Duration corresponds to the duration of the interaction session. Members corresponds to the set of characters involved in the interaction session. Each interaction session represents a time slot in the data where its members are interacting. Note that any change in the formation of members (e.g., a character leaving or joining) indicates a separate interaction session.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “An Efficient Framework for Generating Storyline Visualizations from Streaming Data”:\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFrom “StoryFlow: Tracking the Evolution of Stories”:\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFrom “Crossing Minimization in Storyline Visualizations”:\n\n\n\nUntitled"

Through a query consisting of keywords and Boolean operators, one can retrieve a set of publications on a desired topic. We use the results returned by DBLP to construct networks where nodes are authors and edges indicate co-authorships, weighted by the number of papers shared by their end-nodes. Nodes are labeled with authors’ names and edges with the titles of the corresponding publications. We performed the query “network AND visualization” and limited to 500 the number of search results (i.e., publications) to be returned. The resulting network consists of 1766 nodes, 3780 edges, and 382 connected components. The largest of these components contains 118 nodes and 322 edges."

We considered two typical contexts where DAGs play a fundamental role, namely software engineering and project planning.\n\n\nThe first set of test DAGs are what we call the North DAGs. They are obtained from a collection of directed graphs [28], that North collected at AT&T Bell Labs by running for two years Draw DAG, an e-mail graph drawing service that accepts directed graphs formatted as e-mail messages and returns messages with the corresponding drawings [27].\n\n\nOriginally, the North DAGs consisted of 5114 directed graphs, whose number of vertices varied in the range 1 … 7602. However, the density of the directed graphs with a number of vertices that did not fall in the range 10 … 100 was very low (see also the statistics in [28]); since such directed graphs represent a very sparse statistical population we decided to discard them. Then we noted that many directed graphs were isomorphic; since the vertices of the directed graphs have labels associated with them, the problem is tractable. For each isomorphism class, we kept only one representative directed graph. Also, we deleted the directed graphs where subgraphs were specified as clusters, to be drawn in their own distinct rectangular region of the layout, because constrained algorithms are beyond the scope of this study. This filtering left us with 1277 directed graphs.\n\n\nStill, 491 directed graphs were not connected and this was a problem for running algorithms implemented in G D W (they assume input directed graphs to be connected). Instead of discarding the directed graphs, we followed a more practical approach, by randomly adding a minimum set of directed edges that makes each directed graph connected. Finally, we made the directed graph acyclic, where necessary, by applying some heuristics for inverting the direction of a small subset of edges.\n\n\nWe then ran a first set of experiments and produced the statistics by grouping the DAGs by number of vertices. Although the comparison among the algorithms looked consistent (the produced plots never oddly overlapped), each single plot was not satisfactory, because it showed peaks and valleys. We went back to study the test suite and observed that grouping them by number of vertices was not the best approach. In fact, the North DAGs come from very heterogeneous sources, mainly representing different phases of various software engineering projects; as a result, directed graphs with more or less the same number of vertices may be either very dense or very sparse.\n\n\nSince most of the analyzed quality measures strongly depend on the number of edges of the DAG (e.g. area, number of bends, and number of crossings), we decided that a better approach was to group the DAGs by number of edges. After some tests, we clustered the DAGs into nine groups, each with at least 40 DAGs, so that the number of edges in the DAGs belonging to group i, 1 ≤ i ≤ 9, is in the range 10 i … 10 i+9 (see Fig. 3). The resulting test suite consists of 1158 DAGs, each with edges in the range 10 … 99.\n\nFrom “Layer-Free Upward Crossing Minimization”:\n\nNorth DAGs. The North DAGs have been introduced in an experimental comparison of algorithms for drawing DAGs [Di Battista et al. 2000]. The benchmark set contains 1,158 DAGs collected by Stephen North, which were slightly modified by Di Battista et al. The graphs are grouped into nine sets, where set i contains graphs with 10 i to 10 i+9 arcs for i=1, …, 9.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “Drawing Directed Acyclic Graphs: An Experimental Study”:\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFrom “A Natural Quadratic Approach to the Generalized Graph Layering Problem”:\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-08-09 at 4.26.57 PM.png\n\n\nFrom “A Flow Formulation for Horizontal Coordinate Assignment with Prescribed Width”:\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-08-09 at 4.24.19 PM.png"

To understand whether the experimental results are influenced by the structure of the graph we considered several graph families. All graphs are of small or medium size, expressed as the number of their vertices. In some cases, the size and the number of instances used for each graph family depends on the type of question we want to answer (see Sect. 5 for details). We used the following datasets: Trees. Generated with uniform probability distribution using Pru ̈fer sequences [28]. Planar. Connected simple planar graphs, generated with the OGDF library [6]. General. Connected simple graphs, generated with uniform probability distribution. Scale-free. Scale-free graphs, generated according to the Barabasi-Albert model [2]. Caterpillars. Each caterpillar of n vertices is generated by first creating a path (spine of the caterpillar) of length \\(k\\in [ \\frac{n}{4} , \\frac{n}{2} ]\\) (randomly chosen), and attaching each remaining vertex to a randomly selected vertex of the spine. Paths, Cycles. For each desired number of vertices n, there is only one (unlabeled) path and one (unlabeled) cycle of n vertices. k-ary Trees. Rooted trees where each node has either 0 or k children. Each tree is generated by starting with a single vertex and then creating k children of a randomly selected leaf, until the desired number n of vertices is achieved. When n cannot be obtained, we use a value close to it.\n\nFrom “An Interactive Tool to Explore and Improve the Ply Number of Drawings”:\n\nFM3data contains 50 caterpillars with 250 to 450 vertices… FM3data also contains planar graphs ranging from 250 to 400 vertices and a density ranging from 1.5 to 2… The remaining subset of FM3data consists of general graphs with 250 to 450 vertices and the densities 1.5 and 2.5.\n\n\n\nExample Figures\nFrom “An Experimental Study on the Ply Number of Straight-Line Drawings”:\n\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-08-16 at 3.26.01 PM.png\n\n\n=== STOP RENDERING ===\nDownload links seem to be broken… 😓 in website"
